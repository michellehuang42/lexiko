A1C,https://medlineplus.gov/a1c.html,A1C is a blood test for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. It measures your average blood glucose; or blood sugar; level over the past 3 months. Doctors may use the A1C alone or in combination with other diabetes tests to make a diagnosis. They also use the A1C to see how well you are managing your diabetes. This test is different from the blood sugar checks that people with diabetes do every day.Your A1C test result is given in percentages. The higher the percentage; the higher your blood sugar levels have been:A normal A1C level is below 5.7 percentPrediabetes is between 5.7 to 6.4 percent. Having prediabetes is a risk factor for getting type 2 diabetes. People with prediabetes may need retests every year.Type 2 diabetes is above 6.5 percentIf you have diabetes; you should have the A1C test at least twice a year. The A1C goal for many people with diabetes is below 7. It may be different for you. Ask what your goal should be. If your A1C result is too high; you may need to change your diabetes care plan.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Aortic Aneurysm,https://medlineplus.gov/aorticaneurysm.html,An aneurysm is a bulge or "ballooning" in the wall of an artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to other parts of the body. If an aneurysm grows large; it can burst and cause dangerous bleeding or even death.Most aneurysms are in the aorta; the main artery that runs from the heart through the chest and abdomen.There are two types of aortic aneurysm:Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) - these occur in the part of the aorta running through the chestAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) - these occur in the part of the aorta running through the abdomenMost aneurysms are found during tests done for other reasons. Some people are at high risk for aneurysms. It is important for them to get screening; because aneurysms can develop and become large before causing any symptoms. Screening is recommended for people between the ages of 65 and 75 if they have a family history; or if they are men who have smoked. Doctors use imaging tests to find aneurysms. Medicines and surgery are the two main treatments.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

Abdominal Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/abdominalpain.html,Your abdomen extends from below your chest to your groin. Some people call it the stomach; but your abdomen contains many other important organs. Pain in the abdomen can come from any one of them. The pain may start somewhere else; such as your chest. Severe pain doesn't always mean a serious problem. Nor does mild pain mean a problem is not serious. Call your health care provider if mild pain lasts a week or more or if you have pain with other symptoms. Get medical help immediately ifYou have abdominal pain that is sudden and sharpYou also have pain in your chest; neck or shoulder You're vomiting blood or have blood in your stool Your abdomen is stiff; hard and tender to touch You can't move your bowels; especially if you're also vomiting
Ectopic Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/ectopicpregnancy.html,The uterus; or womb; is the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant. If you have an ectopic pregnancy; the fertilized egg grows in the wrong place; outside the uterus; usually in the fallopian tubes. The result is usually a miscarriage.Ectopic pregnancy can be a medical emergency if it ruptures. Signs of ectopic pregnancy includeAbdominal painShoulder painVaginal bleedingFeeling dizzy or faintGet medical care right away if you have these signs. Doctors use drugs or surgery to remove the ectopic tissue so it doesn't damage your organs. Many women who have had ectopic pregnancies go on to have healthy pregnancies later.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Birth Defects,https://medlineplus.gov/birthdefects.html,A birth defect is a problem that happens while a baby is developing in the mother's body.  Most birth defects happen during the first 3 months of pregnancy. One out of every 33 babies in the United States is born with a birth defect.A birth defect may affect how the body looks; works or both. Some birth defects like cleft lip or neural tube defects are structural problems that can be easy to see. To find others; like heart defects; doctors use special tests. Birth defects can range from mild to severe. Causes can includeGeneticsExposures to medicines or chemicals. For example; alcohol abuse can cause fetal alcohol syndrome.Infections during pregnancyCertain medicines. Before you get pregnant; talk to your health care provider about any medicines you take.Not getting enough of certain nutrients. For example; not getting enough folic acid before and during pregnancy is a key factor in causing neural tube defects.For most birth defects; the cause is unknown.Health care providers can diagnose certain birth defects during pregnancy; with prenatal tests.  That's why it important to get regular prenatal care. Other birth defects may not be found until after the baby is born. Sometimes the defect is obvious right away. Other times; the health care provider may not discover it until later in life.Babies with birth defects often need special care and treatments. The treatments may include surgery; medicines; assistive devices; and therapies.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Blood,https://medlineplus.gov/blood.html,Your blood is made up of liquid and solids. The liquid part; called plasma; is made of water; salts; and protein. Over half of your blood is plasma. The solid part of your blood contains red blood cells; white blood cells; and platelets.Red blood cells (RBC) deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs. White blood cells (WBC) fight infection and are part of your immune system. Platelets help blood to clot when you have a cut or wound. Bone marrow; the spongy material inside your bones; makes new blood cells. Blood cells constantly die and your body makes new ones. Red blood cells live about 120 days; and platelets live about 6 days. Some white blood cells live less than a day; but others live much longer.There are four blood types: A; B; AB; or O. Also; blood is either Rh-positive or Rh-negative. So if you have type A blood; it's either A positive or A negative. Which type you are is important if you need a blood transfusion. And your Rh factor could be important if you become pregnant - an incompatibility between your type and the baby's could create problems. Blood tests such as blood count tests help doctors check for certain diseases and conditions. They also help check the function of your organs and show how well treatments are working. Problems with your blood may include bleeding disorders; excessive clotting and platelet disorders. If you lose too much blood; you may need a transfusion.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Abortion,https://medlineplus.gov/abortion.html,An abortion is a procedure to end a pregnancy. It uses medicine or surgery to remove the embryo or fetus and placenta from the uterus. The procedure is done by a licensed health care professional.The decision to end a pregnancy is very personal. If you are thinking of having an abortion; most health care providers advise counseling.
Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/medicines.html,You may need to take medicines every day; or only once in a while.  Either way; you want to make sure that the medicines are safe and will help you get better. In the United States; the Food and Drug Administration is in charge of assuring the safety and effectiveness of both prescription and over-the-counter medicines. Even safe drugs can cause unwanted side effects or interactions with food or other medicines you may be taking. They may not be safe during pregnancy. To reduce the risk of reactions and make sure that you get better; it is important for you to take your medicines correctly and be careful when giving medicines to children.
Over-the-Counter Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/overthecountermedicines.html,Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are drugs you can buy without a prescription. Some OTC medicines relieve aches; pains and itches. Some prevent or cure diseases; like tooth decay and athlete's foot. Others help manage recurring problems; like migraines.  In the United States; the Food and Drug Administration decides whether a medicine is safe enough to sell over-the-counter.  Taking OTC medicines still has risks. Some interact with other medicines; supplements; foods or drinks. Others cause problems for people with certain medical conditions. If you're pregnant; talk to your health care provider before taking any medicines. It is important to take medicines correctly; and be careful when giving them to children. More medicine does not necessarily mean better. You should never take OTC medicines longer or in higher doses than the label recommends. If your symptoms don't go away; it's a clear signal that it's time to see your health care provider. Food and Drug Administration
Aspergillosis,https://medlineplus.gov/aspergillosis.html,Aspergillosis is a disease caused by a fungus (or mold) called Aspergillus.  The fungus is very common in both indoors and outdoors. Most people breathe in the spores of the fungus every day without being affected. But some people get the disease. It usually occurs in people with lung diseases or weakened immune systems.There are different kinds of aspergillosis. One kind is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (also called ABPA).  Symptoms of ABPA include wheezing and coughing. ABPA can affect healthy people but it is most common in people with asthma or cystic fibrosis.Another kind is invasive aspergillosis; which damages tissues in the body. It usually affects the lungs. Sometimes it can also cause infection in other organs and spread throughout the body. It affects people who have immune system problems; such as people who have had a transplant; are taking high doses of steroids; or getting chemotherapy for some cancers.Your doctor might do a variety of tests to make the diagnosis; including a chest x-ray; CT scan of the lungs; and  an examination of tissues for signs of the fungus. Treatment is with antifungal drugs. If you have ABPA; you may also take steroids.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Abscess,https://medlineplus.gov/abscess.html,An abscess is a pocket of pus. You can get an abscess almost anywhere in your body. When an area of your body becomes infected; your body's immune system tries to fight the infection. White blood cells go to the infected area; collect within the damaged tissue; and cause inflammation. During this process; pus forms. Pus is a mixture of living and dead white blood cells; germs; and dead tissue. Bacteria; viruses; parasites and swallowed objects can all lead to abscesses. Skin abscesses are easy to detect. They are red; raised and painful. Abscesses inside your body may not be obvious and can damage organs; including the brain; lungs and others. Treatments include drainage and antibiotics.
Child Abuse,https://medlineplus.gov/childabuse.html,Child abuse is doing something or failing to do something that results in harm to a child or puts a child at risk of harm. Child abuse can be physical; sexual or emotional. Neglect; or not providing for a child's needs; is also a form of abuse. Most abused children suffer greater emotional than physical damage. An abused child may become depressed. He or she may withdraw; think of suicide or become violent. An older child may use drugs or alcohol; try to run away or abuse others. Child abuse is a serious problem. If you suspect a child is being abused or neglected; call the police or your local child welfare agency.
Domestic Violence,https://medlineplus.gov/domesticviolence.html,Domestic violence is a type of abuse. It usually involves a spouse or partner; but it can also be a child; elderly relative; or other family member.Domestic violence may includePhysical violence that can lead to injuries such as bruises or broken bonesSexual violenceThreats of physical or sexual violenceEmotional abuse that may lead to depression; anxiety; or social isolationEconomic abuse; which involves controlling access to moneyStalking; which causes fear for your own safetyThe first step in getting help is to tell someone you trust; such as a friend; family member; or co-worker. You can also contact your doctor or another health care professional; an emergency shelter; or a domestic violence helpline.The first step in getting help is to tell someone you trust.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Elder Abuse,https://medlineplus.gov/elderabuse.html,Many older people are victims of elder abuse. It is the mistreatment of an older person; usually by a caregiver. It can happen within the family.  It can also happen in assisted living facilities or nursing homes.The mistreatment may bePhysical; sexual; or emotional abuseNeglect or abandonmentFinancial abuse - stealing of money or belongingsPossible signs of elder abuse include unexplained bruises; burns; and injuries. There may also be bed sores and poor hygiene. The person may become withdrawn; agitated; and depressed. There may be a sudden change in the person's financial situation.Elder abuse will not stop on its own. Someone else needs to step in and help. If you think that an older person is in urgent danger; call 9-1-1. Otherwise; contact adult protective services.NIH: National Institute on Aging
Safety,https://medlineplus.gov/safety.html,You can't remove all the safety hazards from your life; but you can reduce them. To avoid many major hazards and prepare for emergenciesKeep emergency phone numbers by your telephonesMake a first aid kit for your homeMake a family emergency planInstall and maintain smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectorsKeep guns unloaded and locked up. Lock up the ammunition separately. Follow the directions carefully when using tools or equipmentYoung children are especially at risk.  Supervision is the best way to keep them safe. Childproofing the house can also help.
Falls,https://medlineplus.gov/falls.html,A fall can change your life. If you're elderly; it can lead to disability and a loss of independence. If your bones are fragile from osteoporosis; you could break a bone; often a hip. But aging alone doesn't make people fall. Diabetes and heart disease affect balance. So do problems with circulation; thyroid or nervous systems. Some medicines make people dizzy. Eye problems or alcohol can be factors. Any of these things can make a fall more likely. Babies and young children are also at risk of falling - off of furniture and down stairs; for example. Falls and accidents seldom "just happen." Taking care of your health by exercising and getting regular eye exams and physicals may help reduce your chance of falling. Getting rid of tripping hazards in your home and wearing nonskid shoes may also help. To reduce the chances of breaking a bone if you do fall; make sure that you get enough calcium and vitamin D.  NIH: National Institute on Aging
First Aid,https://medlineplus.gov/firstaid.html,Accidents happen. Someone chokes on an ice cube or gets stung by a bee. It is important to know when to call 9-1-1 -- it is for life-threatening emergencies.  While waiting for help to arrive; you may be able to save someone's life. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is for people whose hearts or breathing has stopped and the Heimlich maneuver is for people who are choking.You can also learn to handle common injuries and wounds. Cuts and scrapes; for example; should be rinsed with cool water. To stop bleeding; apply firm but gentle pressure; using gauze. If blood soaks through; add more gauze; keeping the first layer in place. Continue to apply pressure. It is important to have a first aid kit available.  Keep one at home and one in your car. It should include a first-aid guide.  Read the guide to learn how to use the items; so you are ready in case an emergency happens.
Wounds and Injuries,https://medlineplus.gov/woundsandinjuries.html,An injury is damage to your body. It is a general term that refers to harm caused by accidents; falls; hits; weapons; and more. In the U.S.; millions of people injure themselves every year. These injuries range from minor to life-threatening. Injuries can happen at work or play; indoors or outdoors; driving a car; or walking across the street.Wounds are injuries that break the skin or other body tissues.   They include cuts; scrapes; scratches; and punctured skin. They often happen because of an accident; but surgery; sutures; and stitches also cause wounds. Minor wounds usually aren't serious; but it is important to clean them. Serious and infected wounds may require first aid followed by a visit to your doctor. You should also seek attention if the wound is deep; you cannot close it yourself; you cannot stop the bleeding or get the dirt out; or it does not heal.Other common types of injuries includeAnimal bitesBruisesBurnsDislocationsElectrical injuriesFracturesSprains and strains
Esophagus Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/esophagusdisorders.html,The esophagus is the muscular tube that carries food; and liquids from your mouth to the stomach. You may not be aware of your esophagus until you swallow something too large; too hot; or too cold. You may also notice it when something is wrong. You may feel pain or have trouble swallowing.The most common problem with the esophagus is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). With GERD; a muscle at the end of your esophagus does not close properly. This allows stomach contents to leak back; or reflux; into the esophagus and irritate it. Over time; GERD can cause damage to the esophagus.Other problems include heartburn; cancer; and esophagitis. Doctors may use various tests to make a diagnosis. These include imaging tests; an upper endoscopy; and a biopsy.Treatment depends on the problem. Some problems get better with over-the-counter medicines or changes in diet. Others may need prescription medicines or surgery.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Heel Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/heelinjuriesanddisorders.html,Heel problems are common and can be painful. Often; they result from too much stress on your heel bone and the tissues that surround it. That stress can come fromInjuriesBruises that you get walking; running or jumping Wearing shoes that don't fit or aren't made wellBeing overweightThese can lead to tendinitis; bursitis; and fasciitis; which are all types of inflammation of the tissues that surround your heel. Over time the stress can cause bone spurs and deformities. Certain diseases; such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout; can also lead to heel problems. Treatments for heel problems might include rest; medicines; exercises; taping; and special shoes. Surgery is rarely needed.
Dwarfism,https://medlineplus.gov/dwarfism.html,People with dwarfism have short stature. This means that their height is under 4' 10" as an adult. They are usually of normal intelligence. Dwarfism most often does happen in families where both parents are of average height.More than 300 different conditions can cause dwarfism. Achondroplasia is the most common type of dwarfism. Achondroplasia is a genetic condition that affects about 1 in 15;000 to 1 in 40;000 people. It makes your arms and legs short in comparison to your head and trunk. You may also have a larger head and weak muscle tone. Other genetic conditions; kidney disease; and problems with metabolism or hormones can also cause dwarfism.The conditions that cause dwarfism can also cause other health problems. Most of them are treatable. It is important to have regular checkups throughout your life.  With proper medical care; most people with dwarfism have active lives and live as long as other people.
GERD,https://medlineplus.gov/gerd.html,Your esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) happens when a muscle at the end of your esophagus does not close properly. This allows stomach contents to leak back; or reflux; into the esophagus and irritate it. You may feel a burning in the chest or throat called heartburn.  Sometimes; you can taste stomach fluid in the back of the mouth.  If you have these symptoms more than twice a week; you may have GERD. You can also have GERD without having heartburn. Your symptoms could include a dry cough; asthma symptoms; or trouble swallowing.Anyone; including infants and children; can have GERD.  If not treated; it can lead to more serious health problems. In some cases; you might need medicines or surgery.  However; many people can improve their symptoms byAvoiding alcohol and spicy; fatty or acidic foods that trigger heartburnEating smaller mealsNot eating close to bedtime Losing weight if needed Wearing loose-fitting clothesNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Heartburn,https://medlineplus.gov/heartburn.html,Heartburn is a painful burning feeling in your chest or throat. It happens when stomach acid backs up into your esophagus; the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach.If you have heartburn more than twice a week; you may have GERD. But you can have GERD without having heartburn.Pregnancy; certain foods; alcohol; and some medications can bring on heartburn. Treating heartburn is important because over time reflux can damage the esophagus.Over-the-counter medicines may help.  If the heartburn continues; you may need prescription medicines or surgery. If you have other symptoms such as crushing chest pain; it could be a heart attack. Get help immediately.
Knee Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/kneeinjuriesanddisorders.html,Your knee joint is made up of bone; cartilage; ligaments and fluid. Muscles and tendons help the knee joint move. When any of these structures is hurt or diseased; you have knee problems. Knee problems can cause pain and difficulty walking.Knee problems are very common; and they occur in people of all ages. Knee problems can interfere with many things; from participation in sports to simply getting up from a chair and walking. This can have a big impact on your life.The most common disease affecting the knee is osteoarthritis. The cartilage in the knee gradually wears away; causing pain and swelling.Injuries to ligaments and tendons also cause knee problems. A common injury is to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). You usually injure your ACL by a sudden twisting motion. ACL and other knee injuries are common sports injuries.Treatment of knee problems depends on the cause. In some cases your doctor may recommend knee replacement.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Acne,https://medlineplus.gov/acne.html,Acne is a common skin disease that causes pimples. Pimples form when hair follicles under your skin clog up. Most pimples form on the face; neck; back; chest; and shoulders. Anyone can get acne; but it is common in teenagers and young adults. It is not serious; but it can cause scars.No one knows exactly what causes acne. Hormone changes; such as those during the teenage years and pregnancy; probably play a role. There are many myths about what causes acne. Chocolate and greasy foods are often blamed; but there is little evidence that foods have much effect on acne in most people. Another common myth is that dirty skin causes acne; however; blackheads and pimples are not caused by dirt. Stress doesn't cause acne; but stress can make it worse.If you have acneClean your skin gently Try not to touch your skin Avoid the sun Treatments for acne include medicines and creams.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Rosacea,https://medlineplus.gov/rosacea.html,Rosacea is a long-term disease that affects your skin and sometimes your eyes. It causes redness and pimples. Rosacea is most common in women and people with fair skin. It most often affects middle-aged and older adults.In most cases; rosacea only affects the face. Symptoms can includeFrequent redness of the face; or flushing Small; red lines under the skinAcneA swollen noseThick skin; usually on the forehead; chin; and cheeks Red; dry; itchy eyes and sometimes vision problems No one knows what causes rosacea. You may be more likely to have it if you blush a lot or if rosacea runs in your family. Rosacea is not dangerous. There is no cure; but treatments can help. They include medicines and sometimes surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Acoustic Neuroma,https://medlineplus.gov/acousticneuroma.html,An acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor that develops on the nerve that connects the ear to the brain. The tumor usually grows slowly. As it grows; it presses against the hearing and balance nerves. At first; you may have no symptoms or mild symptoms. They can include Loss of hearing on one side  Ringing in ears Dizziness and balance problemsThe tumor can also eventually cause numbness or paralysis of the face. If it grows large enough; it can press against the brain; becoming life-threatening.Acoustic neuroma can be difficult to diagnose; because the symptoms are similar to those of middle ear problems.  Ear exams; hearing tests; and scans can show if you have it.If the tumor stays small; you may only need to have it checked regularly.  If you do need treatment; surgery and radiation are options.If the tumors affect both hearing nerves; it is often because of a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders
HIV/AIDS,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaids.html,HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection. This puts you at risk for serious infections and certain cancers. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.HIV most often spreads through unprotected sex with an infected person. It may also spread by sharing drug needles or through contact with the blood of an infected person. Women can give it to their babies during pregnancy or childbirth. The first signs of HIV infection may be swollen glands and flu-like symptoms. These may come and go within two to four weeks. Severe symptoms may not appear until months or years later.A blood test can tell if you have HIV infection. Your health care provider can do the test; or you can use a home testing kit. Or to find free testing sites; call the national referral hotline at 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636 in English and en espaol; 1-888-232-6348 - TTY). There is no cure; but there are many medicines that fight HIV infection and lower the risk of infecting others. People who get early treatment can live with the disease for a long time.
Growth Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/growthdisorders.html,Does your child seem much shorter - or much taller - than other kids his or her age? It could be normal. Some children may be small for their age but still be developing normally. Some children are short or tall because their parents are.But some children have growth disorders.  Growth disorders are problems that prevent children from developing normal height; weight; sexual maturity or other features.Very slow or very fast growth can sometimes signal a gland problem or disease.The pituitary gland makes growth hormone; which stimulates the growth of bone and other tissues. Children who have too little of it may be very short. Treatment with growth hormone can stimulate growth.People can also have too much growth hormone.  Usually the cause is a pituitary gland tumor; which is not cancer.  Too much growth hormone can cause gigantism in children; where their bones and their body grow too much.  In adults; it can cause acromegaly; which makes the hands; feet and face larger than normal. Possible treatments include surgery to remove the tumor; medicines; and radiation therapy.
Pituitary Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/pituitarydisorders.html,Your pituitary gland is a pea-sized gland at the base of your brain. The pituitary is the "master control gland" - it makes hormones that affect growth and the functions of other glands in the body.  With pituitary disorders; you often have too much or too little of one of your hormones.  Injuries can cause pituitary disorders; but the most common cause is a pituitary tumor.
Skin Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/skincancer.html,Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States. The two most common types are basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer. They usually form on the head; face; neck; hands; and arms. Another type of skin cancer; melanoma; is more dangerous but less common. Anyone can get skin cancer; but it is more common in people who Spend a lot of time in the sun or have been sunburnedHave light-colored skin; hair and eyesHave a family member with skin cancerAre over age 50You should have your doctor check any suspicious skin markings and any changes in the way your skin looks. Treatment is more likely to work well when cancer is found early.  If not treated; some types of skin cancer cells can spread to other tissues and organs. Treatments include surgery; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; photodynamic therapy (PDT); and biologic therapy. PDT uses a drug and a type of laser light to kill cancer cells. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Sun Exposure,https://medlineplus.gov/sunexposure.html,Ultraviolet (UV) rays are an invisible form of radiation. They can pass through your skin and damage your skin cells. Sunburns are a sign of skin damage. Suntans aren't healthy; either. They appear after the sun's rays have already killed some cells and damaged others. UV rays can cause skin damage during any season or at any temperature.  They can also cause eye problems; wrinkles; skin spots; and skin cancer.To protect yourself Stay out of the sun when it is strongest (between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.)Use sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher Wear protective clothing Wear wraparound sunglasses that provide 100 percent UV ray protectionAvoid sunlamps and tanning beds Check your skin regularly for changes in the size; shape; color; or feel of birthmarks; moles; and spots. Such changes are a sign of skin cancer. Food and Drug Administration
Acupuncture,https://medlineplus.gov/acupuncture.html,Acupuncture has been practiced in China and other Asian countries for thousands of years. Acupuncture involves stimulating specific points on the body. This is most often done by inserting thin needles through the skin; to cause a change in the physical functions of the body.Research has shown that acupuncture reduces nausea and vomiting after surgery and chemotherapy. It can also relieve pain. Researchers don't fully understand how acupuncture works. It might aid the activity of your body's pain-killing chemicals. It also might affect how you release chemicals that regulate blood pressure and flow.NIH: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health
Acute Bronchitis,https://medlineplus.gov/acutebronchitis.html,Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes; the airways that carry air to your lungs. It causes a cough that often brings up mucus. It can also cause shortness of breath; wheezing; a low fever; and chest tightness. There are two main types of bronchitis: acute and chronic.Most cases of acute bronchitis get better within several days. But your cough can last for several weeks after the infection is gone.The same viruses that cause colds and the flu often cause acute bronchitis. These viruses spread through the air when people cough; or though physical contact (for example; on unwashed hands). Being exposed to tobacco smoke; air pollution; dusts; vapors; and fumes can also cause acute bronchitis. Less often; bacteria can also cause acute bronchitis.To diagnose acute bronchitis; your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and listen to your breathing. You may also have other tests.Treatments include rest; fluids; and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. A humidifier or steam can also help. You may need inhaled medicine to open your airways if you are wheezing. Antibiotics won't help if the cause is viral. You may get antibiotics if the cause is bacterial.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia,https://medlineplus.gov/acutelymphocyticleukemia.html,Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infection. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. In leukemia; however; the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells; making it hard for blood to do its work. In acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL); also called acute lymphoblastic leukemia; there are too many of specific types of white blood cells called lymphocytes or lymphoblasts.  ALL is the most common type of cancer in children.Possible risk factors for ALL include being male; being white; previous chemotherapy treatment; exposure to radiation; and for adults; being older than 70.Symptoms of ALL include:Weakness or feeling tiredFeverEasy bruising or bleedingBleeding under the skinShortness of breathWeight loss or loss of appetitePain in the bones or stomachPain or a feeling of fullness below the ribsPainless lumps in the neck; underarm; stomach; or groinTests that examine the blood and bone marrow diagnose ALL. Treatments include chemotherapy; radiation therapy; stem cell transplants; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. Once the leukemia is in remission; you need additional treatment to make sure that it does not come back.NIH: National Cancer Institute

Treatments include chemotherapy; radiation therapy; stem cell transplants; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. Once the leukemia is in remission; you need additional treatment to make sure that it does not come back.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Acute Myeloid Leukemia,https://medlineplus.gov/acutemyeloidleukemia.html,Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infection. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. In leukemia; however; the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells; making it hard for blood to do its work. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML); there are too many of a specific type of white blood cell called a myeloblast.AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated. Possible risk factors include smoking; previous chemotherapy treatment; and exposure to radiation. Symptoms of AML include:FeverShortness of breathEasy bruising or bleedingBleeding under the skinWeakness or feeling tiredWeight loss or loss of appetiteTests that examine the blood and bone marrow diagnose AML. Treatments include chemotherapy; other drugs; radiation therapy; stem cell transplants; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.

Pancreatitis,https://medlineplus.gov/pancreatitis.html,The pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach and close to the first part of the small intestine. It secretes digestive juices into the small intestine through a tube called the pancreatic duct. The pancreas also releases the hormones insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream.Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. It happens when digestive enzymes start digesting the pancreas itself. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Either form is serious and can lead to complications.Acute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and usually goes away in a few days with treatment. It is often caused by gallstones.  Common symptoms are severe pain in the upper abdomen; nausea; and vomiting.   Treatment is usually a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids; antibiotics; and medicines to relieve pain.Chronic pancreatitis does not heal or improve. It gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. The most common cause is heavy alcohol use. Other causes include cystic fibrosis and other inherited disorders; high levels of calcium or fats in the blood; some medicines; and autoimmune conditions. Symptoms include nausea; vomiting; weight loss; and oily stools. Treatment may also be a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids; medicines to relieve pain; and nutritional support. After that; you may need to start taking enzymes and eat a special diet.  It is also important to not smoke or drink alcohol.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Respiratory Failure,https://medlineplus.gov/respiratoryfailure.html,Respiratory failure happens when not enough oxygen passes from your lungs into your blood. Your body's organs; such as your heart and brain; need oxygen-rich blood to work well. Respiratory failure also can happen if your lungs can't remove carbon dioxide (a waste gas) from your blood. Too much carbon dioxide in your blood can harm your body's organs. Diseases and conditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure. Examples include  Lung diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); pneumonia; pulmonary embolism; and cystic fibrosis Conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing; such as spinal cord injuries; muscular dystrophy and stroke Damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs. An injury to the chest can cause this damage. Drug or alcohol overdose Injuries from inhaling smoke or harmful fumes  Treatment for respiratory failure depends on whether the condition is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) and how severe it is. It also depends on the underlying cause. You may receive oxygen therapy and other treatment to help you breathe. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,https://medlineplus.gov/attentiondeficithyperactivitydisorder.html,Is it hard for your child to sit still? Does your child act without thinking first? Does your child start but not finish things? If so; your child may have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Nearly everyone shows some of these behaviors at times; but ADHD lasts more than 6 months and causes problems in school; at home and in social situations.ADHD is more common in boys than girls. It affects 3-5 percent of all American children.The main features of ADHD areInattentionHyperactivityImpulsivityNo one knows exactly what causes ADHD. It sometimes runs in families; so genetics may be a factor. There may also be environmental factors.A complete evaluation by a trained professional is the only way to know for sure if your child has ADHD.  Treatment may include medicine to control symptoms; therapy; or both. Structure at home and at school is important. Parent training may also help.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
Addison Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/addisondisease.html,Your adrenal glands are just above your kidneys. The outside layer of these glands makes hormones that help your body respond to stress and regulate your blood pressure and water and salt balance.  Addison disease happens if the adrenal glands don't make enough of these hormones.A problem with your immune system usually causes Addison disease. The immune system mistakenly attacks your own tissues; damaging your adrenal glands. Other causes include infections and cancer.Symptoms includeWeight lossMuscle weaknessFatigue that gets worse over timeLow blood pressurePatchy or dark skin Lab tests can confirm that you have Addison disease.  If you don't treat it; it can be fatal. You will need to take hormone pills for the rest of your life.  If you have Addison disease; you should carry an emergency ID. It should say that you have the disease; list your medicines and say how much you need in an emergency.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Adenoids,https://medlineplus.gov/adenoids.html,What are adenoids?Adenoids are a patch of tissue that is high up in the throat; just behind the nose. They; along with the tonsils; are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance. The adenoids and tonsils work by trapping germs coming in through the mouth and nose.Adenoids usually start to shrink after about age 5. By the teenage years; they are almost completely gone. By then; the body has other ways to fight germs.What are enlarged adenoids? Enlarged adenoids are adenoids that are swollen. It is a common problem in children.What causes enlarged adenoids?Your child's adenoids can be enlarged; or swollen; for different reasons. It may just be that your child had enlarged adenoids at birth. Adenoids can also become enlarged when they are trying to fight off an infection. They might stay enlarged even after the infection is gone.What problems can enlarged adenoids cause?Enlarged adenoids can make it hard to breathe through the nose.  Your child might end up breathing only through the mouth. This may causeA dry mouth; which can also lead to bad breathCracked lipsA runny noseOther problems that enlarged adenoids can cause includeLoud breathingSnoringRestless sleepSleep apnea; where you repeatedly stop breathing for a few seconds while sleepingEar infectionsHow can enlarged adenoids be diagnosedYour child's health care provider will take a medical history; check your child's ears; throat; and mouth; and feel your child's neck.Since the adenoids are higher up than the throat; the health care provider cannot see them just by looking through your child's mouth.  To check the size of your child's adenoids; your provider may useA special mirror in the mouthA long; flexible tube with a light (an endoscope)An x-rayWhat are the treatments for enlarged adenoids?The treatment depends on what is causing the problem. If your child's symptoms are not too bad; he or she may not need treatment. Your child might get nasal spray to reduce the swelling; or antibiotics if the health care provider thinks that your child has a bacterial infection.In some cases your child may need an adenoidectomy.What is an adenoidectomy and why might I my child need one?An adenoidectomy is surgery to remove the adenoids. Your child might need it ifHe or she has repeated infections of the adenoids. Sometimes the infections can also cause ear infections and fluid buildup in the middle ear.Antibiotics can't get rid of a bacterial infectionThe enlarged adenoids block the airwaysIf your child also has problems with his or her tonsils; he or she will probably have a tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils) at the same time that the adenoids are removed.After having the surgery; your child usually goes home the same day. He or she will probably have some throat pain; bad breath; and a runny nose. It can take several days to feel all better.

Benign Tumors,https://medlineplus.gov/benigntumors.html,Tumors are abnormal growths in your body. They can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. Benign tumors grow only in one place. They cannot spread or invade other parts of your body. Even so; they can be dangerous if they press on vital organs; such as your brain.Tumors are made up of extra cells. Normally; cells grow and divide to form new cells as your body needs them. When cells grow old; they die; and new cells take their place. Sometimes; this process goes wrong. New cells form when your body does not need them; and old cells do not die when they should. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form tumor.Treatment often involves surgery. Benign tumors usually don't grow back.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Endometriosis,https://medlineplus.gov/endometriosis.html,The uterus; or womb; is the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant. Endometriosis is a disease in which the kind of tissue that normally grows inside the uterus grows outside the uterus. It can grow on the ovaries; fallopian tubes; bowels; or bladder. Rarely; it grows in other parts of the body. Symptoms includePain; usually in the abdomen; lower back; or pelvic areasInfertilityHeavy periods and bleeding between periodsPainful menstrual crampsSome women have no symptoms at all. Having trouble getting pregnant may be the first sign.The cause of endometriosis is not known. Surgery; usually a laparoscopy; is currently the only way to be sure that you have endometriosis. Your health care provider will first take your medical history; do a pelvic exam; and maybe do imaging tests.There is no cure; but treatments help with pain and infertility. They include pain medicines; hormone treatments; and surgery.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Viral Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/viralinfections.html,Viruses are very tiny germs. They are made of genetic material inside of a protein coating. Viruses cause familiar infectious diseases such as the common cold; flu and warts. They also cause severe illnesses such as HIV/AIDS; smallpox; and Ebola.Viruses are like hijackers. They invade living; normal cells and use those cells to multiply and produce other viruses like themselves. This can kill; damage; or change the cells and make you sick. Different viruses attack certain cells in your body such as your liver; respiratory system; or blood.When you get a virus; you may not always get sick from it. Your immune system may be able to fight it off.For most viral infections; treatments can only help with symptoms while you wait for your immune system to fight off the virus. Antibiotics do not work for viral infections. There are antiviral medicines to treat some viral infections. Vaccines can help prevent you from getting many viral diseases.

Adhesions,https://medlineplus.gov/adhesions.html,Adhesions are bands of scar-like tissue. Normally; internal tissues and organs have slippery surfaces so they can shift easily as the body moves. Adhesions cause tissues and organs to stick together. They might connect the loops of the intestines to each other; to nearby organs; or to the wall of the abdomen. They can pull sections of the intestines out of place. This may block food from passing through the intestine.Adhesions can occur anywhere in the body. But they often form after surgery on the abdomen. Almost everyone who has surgery on the abdomen gets adhesions. Some adhesions don't cause any problems. But when they partly or completely block the intestines; they cause symptoms such asSevere abdominal pain or crampingVomitingBloatingAn inability to pass gasConstipationAdhesions can sometimes cause infertility in women by preventing fertilized eggs from reaching the uterus.No tests are available to detect adhesions.  Doctors usually find them during surgery to diagnose other problems.Some adhesions go away by themselves. If they partly block your intestines; a diet low in fiber can allow food to move easily through the affected area. If you have a complete intestinal obstruction; it is life threatening. You should get immediate medical attention and may need surgery. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Teen Development,https://medlineplus.gov/teendevelopment.html,As a teenager; you go through many physical; mental; emotional; and social changes.

Some are in foster care; a temporary home setting. Other children live in orphanages or with birth relatives until they can be adopted.There are different kinds of adoption. Children may be adopted by a relative or a new family. Some parents adopt children from the U.S; and some adopt from abroad.
Adrenal Gland Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/adrenalglandcancer.html,Your adrenal; or suprarenal; glands are located on the top of each kidney. These glands produce hormones that you can't live without; including sex hormones and cortisol; which helps you respond to stress and has many other functions.A number of disorders can affect the adrenal glands; including tumors.   Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. Most adrenal gland tumors are benign.  They usually do not cause symptoms and may not require treatment. Malignant adrenal gland cancers are uncommon.Types of tumors includeAdrenocortical carcinoma - cancer in the outer part of the glandNeuroblastoma; a type of childhood cancerPheochromocytoma - a rare tumor that is usually benignSymptoms depend on the type of cancer you have. Treatments may include surgery; chemotherapy; or radiation therapy.
Adrenal Gland Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/adrenalglanddisorders.html,The adrenal glands are small glands located on top of each kidney.  They produce hormones that you can't live without; including sex hormones and cortisol. Cortisol helps you respond to stress and has many other important functions.With adrenal gland disorders; your glands make too much or not enough hormones. In Cushing's syndrome; there's too much cortisol; while with Addison's disease; there is too little. Some people are born unable to make enough cortisol.Causes of adrenal gland disorders includeGenetic mutationsTumors including pheochromocytomasInfectionsA problem in another gland; such as the pituitary; which helps to regulate the adrenal glandCertain medicinesTreatment depends on which problem you have.  Surgery or medicines can treat many adrenal gland disorders.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development

Leukodystrophies,https://medlineplus.gov/leukodystrophies.html,The leukodystrophies are rare diseases that affect the cells of the brain. Specifically; the diseases affect the myelin sheath; the material that surrounds and protects nerve cells. Damage to this sheath slows down or blocks messages between the brain and the rest of the body. This leads to problems with  Movement Speaking Vision Hearing  Mental and physical development   Most of the leukodystrophies are genetic. They usually appear during infancy or childhood. They can be hard to detect early because children seem healthy at first. However; symptoms gradually get worse over time.   There are no cures for any of the leukodystrophies. Medicines; speech therapy and physical therapy might help with symptoms. Researchers are testing bone marrow transplantation as a treatment for some of the leukodystrophies.  NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Immunization,https://medlineplus.gov/immunization.html,Shots may hurt a little; but the diseases they can prevent are a lot worse.  Some are even life-threatening. Immunization shots; or vaccinations; are essential. They protect against things like measles; mumps; rubella; hepatitis B; polio; tetanus; diphtheria; and pertussis (whooping cough). Immunizations are important for adults as well as children.Your immune system helps your body fight germs by producing substances to combat them. Once it does; the immune system "remembers" the germ and can fight it again. Vaccines contain germs that have been killed or weakened. When given to a healthy person; the vaccine triggers the immune system to respond and thus build immunity. Before vaccines; people became immune only by actually getting a disease and surviving it. Immunizations are an easier and less risky way to become immune. NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Advance Directives,https://medlineplus.gov/advancedirectives.html,What kind of medical care would you want if you were too ill or hurt to express your wishes?

They give you a way to tell your wishes to family; friends; and health care professionals and to avoid confusion later on. A living will tells which treatments you want if you are dying or permanently unconscious. You can accept or refuse medical care. You might want to include instructions onThe use of dialysis and breathing machinesIf you want to be resuscitated if your breathing or heartbeat stops Tube feedingOrgan or tissue donation A durable power of attorney for health care is a document that names your health care proxy. Your proxy is someone you trust to make health decisions for you if you are unable to do so. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Atrial Fibrillation,https://medlineplus.gov/atrialfibrillation.html,An arrhythmia is a problem with the speed or rhythm of the heartbeat.  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of arrhythmia. The cause is a disorder in the heart's electrical system.Often; people who have AF may not even feel symptoms. But you may feelPalpitations -- an abnormal rapid heartbeatShortness of breathWeakness or difficulty exercisingChest painDizziness or faintingFatigueConfusionAF can lead to an increased risk of stroke. In many patients; it can also cause chest pain; heart attack; or heart failure. Doctors diagnose AF using family and medical history; a physical exam; and a test called an electrocardiogram (EKG); which looks at the electrical waves your heart makes. Treatments include medicines and procedures to restore normal rhythm.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Health Insurance,https://medlineplus.gov/healthinsurance.html,Health insurance helps protect you from high medical care costs. It is a contract between you and your insurance company. You buy a plan or policy; and the company agrees to pay part of your expenses when you need medical care.Many people in the United States get a health insurance policy through their employers. In most cases; the employer helps pay for that insurance. Insurance through employers is often with a managed care plan. These plans contract with health care providers and medical facilities to provide care for members at reduced costs. You can also purchase health insurance on your own.People who meet certain requirements can qualify for government health insurance; such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act expands health insurance coverage for many people in the U.S.

Macular Degeneration,https://medlineplus.gov/maculardegeneration.html,Macular degeneration; or age-related macular degeneration (AMD); is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. It is a disease that destroys your sharp; central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving. AMD affects the macula; the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt; but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked.Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision.NIH: National Eye Institute
Veterans and Military Health,https://medlineplus.gov/veteransandmilitaryhealth.html,Military service members and veterans have made sacrifices to our country; and they face different health issues than civilians. During their service; they are at risk for various injuries. These injuries can happen during combat; while others involve physical stress to the body. Sometimes the injuries are life-threatening or serious enough to cause disability. Others may not be as serious; but can be painful and affect daily life. Specific types of injuries include Shrapnel and gunshot woundsLost limbsHead and brain injuriesTinnitus and hearing loss; typically from exposure to noiseSprains and strainsLimited range of motion; especially in ankles and kneesThere may also be a risk of health problems from exposure to environmental hazards; such as contaminated water; chemicals; infections; and burn pits.Being in combat and being separated from your family can be stressful. The stress can put service members and veterans at risk for mental health problems. These include anxiety; post-traumatic stress disorder; depression and substance abuse. Suicide can also be a concern.
Taste and Smell Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/tasteandsmelldisorders.html,Our senses of taste and smell give us great pleasure. Taste helps us enjoy food and beverages. Smell lets us enjoy the scents and fragrances like roses or coffee. Taste and smell also protect us; letting us know when food has gone bad or when there is a gas leak. They make us want to eat; ensuring we get the nutrition we need. People with taste disorders may taste things that aren't there; may not be able to tell the difference in tastes; or can't taste at all. People with smell disorders may lose their sense of smell; or things may smell different.  A smell they once enjoyed may now smell bad to them. Many illnesses and injuries can cause taste and smell disorders; including colds and head injuries. Some drugs can also affect taste and smell. Most people lose some ability to taste and smell as they get older. Treatment varies; depending on the problem and its cause. NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders

HIV/AIDS,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaids.html,HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection. This puts you at risk for serious infections and certain cancers. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.HIV most often spreads through unprotected sex with an infected person. It may also spread by sharing drug needles or through contact with the blood of an infected person. Women can give it to their babies during pregnancy or childbirth. The first signs of HIV infection may be swollen glands and flu-like symptoms. These may come and go within two to four weeks. Severe symptoms may not appear until months or years later.A blood test can tell if you have HIV infection. Your health care provider can do the test; or you can use a home testing kit. Or to find free testing sites; call the national referral hotline at 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636 in English and en espaol; 1-888-232-6348 - TTY). There is no cure; but there are many medicines that fight HIV infection and lower the risk of infecting others. People who get early treatment can live with the disease for a long time.
HIV/AIDS and Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaidsandinfections.html,Having HIV/AIDS weakens your body's immune system. It destroys the white blood cells that fight infection. This puts you at risk for opportunistic infections (OIs). OIs are serious infections that take advantage of your weak immune system. These infections are less common and less severe in healthy people.There are many types of OIs:Bacterial infections; including tuberculosis and a serious related disease; Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)Viral infections; such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis CFungal infections; like yeast infections; cryptococcal meningitis; pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and histoplasmosisParasitic infections; such as crypto (cryptosporidiosis) and toxo (toxoplasmosis)Having HIV/AIDS can make infections harder to treat. People with HIV/AIDS are also more likely to have complications from common illnesses such as the flu.You can help prevent infections by taking your HIV/AIDS medicines. Other things that can help include practicing safe sex; washing your hands well and often; and cooking your food thoroughly.
HIV/AIDS and Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaidsandpregnancy.html,If you are pregnant and have HIV/AIDS;there is a risk of passing HIV to your baby. It can happen in three ways:During pregnancyDuring childbirth; especially if it is vaginal childbirth. In some cases; your doctor may suggest doing a Cesarean section to lower the risk during childbirth.During breastfeedingYou can greatly lower that risk by taking HIV/AIDS medicines. These medicines will also help protect your health. Since some medicines are not safe for babies; it is important to talk with your health care provider about which ones you should take. Then you need to make sure you take your medicines regularly.Your baby will get HIV/AIDS medicines for 4 to 6 weeks after birth. The medicines protect your baby from infection from any HIV that passed from you during childbirth. Your baby will get several tests to check for HIV over the first few months.Some pregnant women with HIV/AIDS may not know that they have it. So it is important that all women who are pregnant or planning to get pregnant have an HIV test as early as possible. Because most pregnant women with HIV/AIDS and their babies take HIV/AIDS medicines; few babies in the United States get HIV.
HIV/AIDS in Women,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaidsinwomen.html,HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection.  AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.HIV often spreads through unprotected sex with an infected person. Women can get it more easily during vaginal sex than men can. HIV may also spread by sharing drug needles or through contact with the blood of an infected person.About one in four people in the United States who have HIV are women. Women who have HIV/AIDS have some different problems from men; such asComplications such as repeated vaginal yeast infections; severe pelvic inflammatory disease (PID); and a higher risk of cervical cancerDifferent; sometimes more severe; side effects from the drugs that treat HIV/AIDSDrug interactions between some HIV/AIDS medicines and hormonal birth controlThe risk of giving HIV to their baby while pregnant or during childbirthWomen often don't get diagnosed until they are in the later in the stages of HIV infection. This means that they may be more at risk of infections.There is no cure; but there are many medicines to fight both HIV infection and the infections and cancers that come with it. People who get early treatment can live with the disease for a long time.
HIV/AIDS Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaidsmedicines.html,In the early 1980s; when the HIV/AIDS epidemic began; patients rarely lived longer than a few years. But today; there are many effective medicines to fight the infection; and people with HIV have longer; healthier lives.There are five major types of medicines:Reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors - interfere with a critical step during the HIV life cycle and keep the virus from making copies of itselfProtease inhibitors - interfere with a protein that HIV uses to make infectious viral particlesFusion inhibitors - block the virus from entering the body's cellsIntegrase inhibitors - block an enzyme HIV needs to make copies of itselfMultidrug combinations - combine two or more different types of drugs into oneThese medicines help people with HIV; but they are not perfect. They do not cure HIV/AIDS. People with HIV infection still have the virus in their bodies. They can still spread HIV to others through unprotected sex and needle sharing; even when they are taking their medicines.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Living with HIV/AIDS,https://medlineplus.gov/livingwithhivaids.html,HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.Infection with HIV is serious. But thanks to better treatments; people with HIV/AIDS are now living longer; and have a better quality of life. If you have HIV; you can help yourself byGetting medical care as soon as you find out that you have HIVFinding a health care provider has experience in treating HIV/AIDSIf are on any medicines; make sure to take them regularlyGetting support; such as from support groups; therapists; and social service organizationsLearning as much as you can about HIV/AIDS and its treatmentTrying to live a healthy lifestyle; including eating healthy foods; exercising regularly; and getting enough sleepIt is also important to reduce the risk of spreading HIV to other people. You should tell your sex partners that you have HIV; and always use condoms.
Air Pollution,https://medlineplus.gov/airpollution.html,Air pollution is a mixture of solid particles and gases in the air. Car emissions; chemicals from factories; dust; pollen and mold spores may be suspended as particles. Ozone; a gas; is a major part of air pollution in cities. When ozone forms air pollution; it's also called smog. Some air pollutants are poisonous. Inhaling them can increase the chance you'll have health problems. People with heart or lung disease; older adults and children are at greater risk from air pollution. Air pollution isn't just outside - the air inside  buildings can also be polluted and affect your health. Environmental Protection Agency
Motion Sickness,https://medlineplus.gov/motionsickness.html,Motion sickness is a common problem in people traveling by car; train; airplanes; and especially boats. Anyone can get it; but it is more common in children; pregnant women; and people taking certain medicines. Motion sickness can start suddenly; with a queasy feeling and cold sweats. It can then lead to dizziness and nausea and vomiting.Your brain senses movement by getting signals from your inner ears; eyes; muscles; and joints. When it gets signals that do not match; you can get motion sickness. For example; if you are reading on your phone while riding a bus; your eyes are focused on something that is not moving; but your inner ear senses motion.Where you sit can make a difference. The front seat of a car; forward cars of a train; upper deck on a boat or wing seats in a plane may give you a smoother ride. Looking out into the distance - instead of trying to read or look at something in the vehicle - can also help. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Liver Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html,Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons.There are many kinds of liver diseases:Diseases caused by  viruses; such as hepatitis A; hepatitis B; and hepatitis CDiseases caused by drugs; poisons; or too much alcohol. Examples include fatty liver disease and cirrhosis.Liver cancerInherited diseases; such as hemochromatosis and Wilson diseaseSymptoms of liver disease can vary; but they often include swelling of the abdomen and legs; bruising easily; changes in the color of your stool and urine; and jaundice; or yellowing of the skin and eyes. Sometimes there are no symptoms. Tests such as imaging tests and liver function tests can check for liver damage and help to diagnose liver diseases.

Alcohol,https://medlineplus.gov/alcohol.html,If you are like many Americans; you drink alcohol at least occasionally. For many people; moderate drinking is probably safe. It may even have health benefits; including reducing your risk of certain heart problems. For most women and for most people over 65; moderate drinking is no more than three drinks a day or seven drinks per week. For men under 65; it is no more than four drinks a day or 14 drinks per week.Some people should not drink at all; including alcoholics; children; pregnant women; people taking certain medicines; and people with certain medical conditions. If you have questions about whether it is safe for you to drink; speak with your health care provider.Anything more than moderate drinking can be risky. Heavy drinking can lead to alcoholism and alcohol abuse; as well as injuries; liver disease; heart disease; cancer; and other health problems. It can also cause problems at home; at work; and with friends.NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
Pregnancy and Substance Abuse,https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancyandsubstanceabuse.html,When you are pregnant; you are not just "eating for two." You also breathe and drink for two; so it is important to carefully consider what you give to your baby.  If you smoke; use alcohol or take illegal drugs; so does your unborn baby.First; don't smoke.

Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse,https://medlineplus.gov/alcoholismandalcoholabuse.html,For most adults; moderate alcohol use is probably not harmful. However; about 18 million adult Americans have an alcohol use disorder (AUD).  This means that their drinking causes distress and harm.  It includes alcoholism and alcohol abuse.Alcoholism; or alcohol dependence; is a disease that causesCraving - a strong need to drinkLoss of control - not being able to stop drinking once you've startedPhysical dependence - withdrawal symptomsTolerance - the need to drink more alcohol to feel the same effectWith alcohol abuse; you are not physically dependent; but you still have a serious problem. The drinking may cause problems at home; work; or school. It may cause you to put yourself in dangerous situations; or lead to legal or social problems.Another common problem is binge drinking. It is drinking about five or more drinks in two hours for men.  For women; it is about four or more drinks in two hours.Too much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It can cause damage to the liver; brain; and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can harm your baby. Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes; injuries; homicide; and suicide.You may have an AUD if you can answer yes to two or more of these questions:In the past year; have youEnded up drinking more or for a longer time than you had planned to?Wanted to cut down or stop drinking; or tried to; but couldn't?Spent a lot of your time drinking; or recovering from drinking?Felt a strong need to drink?Found that drinking - or being sick from drinking - often interfered with your family life; job; or school?Kept drinking even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends?Given up or cut back on activities that you enjoyed just so you could drink?Gotten into dangerous situations while drinking or after drinking? Some examples are driving drunk and having unsafe sex.Kept drinking even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious? Or when it was adding to another health problem?Had to drink more and more to feel the effects of the alcohol?Had withdrawal symptoms when the alcohol was wearing off? They include trouble sleeping; shakiness; irritability; anxiety; depression; restlessness; nausea; and sweating. In severe cases; you could have a fever; seizures; or hallucinations.If you have any of these symptoms; your drinking may already be a cause for concern. The more symptoms you have; the more serious the problem is. If you think you might have an AUD; see your health care provider for an evaluation. Your provider can help make a treatment plan; prescribe medicines; and if needed; give you treatment referrals.NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) Treatment,https://medlineplus.gov/alcoholusedisorderaudtreatment.html,What is an alcohol use disorder?An alcohol use disorder (AUD) is drinking that causes distress and harm. It is a medical condition in which youDrink alcohol compulsivelyCan't control how much you drinkFeel anxious; irritable; and/or stressed when you are not drinkingTypes of AUDs include alcoholism (also called alcohol dependence); and alcohol abuse.What are the treatments for alcohol use disorder?Most people with an alcohol use disorder can benefit from some form of treatment. Medical treatments include medicines and behavioral therapies. For many people; using both types gives them the best results. People who are getting treatment for AUD may also find it helpful to go to a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). If you have an AUD and a mental illness; it is important to get treatment for both.Some people may need intensive treatment for AUD. They may go to a residential treatment center for rehabilitation (rehab). Treatment there is highly structured. It usually includes several different kinds of behavioral therapies. It may also include medicines for detox (medical treatment for alcohol withdrawal) and/or for treating the AUD.Which medicines can treat alcohol use disorder?Three medicines are approved to treat AUD:Disulfiram causes unpleasant symptoms such as nausea and skin flushing whenever you drink alcohol. Knowing that drinking will cause these unpleasant effects may help you stay away from alcohol.Naltrexone blocks the receptors in your brain that make you feel good when you drink alcohol. It can also reduce your craving for alcohol. This can help you cut back on your drinking.Acamprosate helps you avoid alcohol after you have quit drinking. It works on multiple brain systems to reduce your cravings; especially just after you have quit drinking.Your health care provider can help you figure out if one of these medicines is right for you. They are not addictive; so you don't have to worry about trading one addiction for another. They are not a cure; but they can help you manage AUD. This is just like taking medicines to manage a chronic disease such as asthma or diabetes.Which behavioral therapies can treat alcohol use disorder?Another name for behavioral therapies is alcohol counseling. It involves working with a health care professional to identify and help change the behaviors that lead to your heavy drinking.Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps you identify the feelings and situations that can lead to heavy drinking. It teaches you coping skills; including how to manage stress and how to change the thoughts that cause you to want to drink. You may get CBT one-on-one with a therapist or in small groups.Motivational enhancement therapy helps you build and strengthen the motivation to change your drinking behavior. It includes about four sessions over a short period of time. The therapy starts with identifying the pros and cons of seeking treatment. Then you and your therapist work on forming a plan for making changes in your drinking. The next sessions focus on building up your confidence and developing the skills you need to be able to stick to the plan.Marital and family counseling includes spouses and other family members. It can help to repair and improve your family relationships. Studies show that strong family support through family therapy may help you to stay away from drinking.Brief interventions are short; one-on-one or small-group counseling sessions. It includes one to four sessions. The counselor gives you information about your drinking pattern and potential risks. The counselor works with you to set goals and provide ideas that may help you make a change.Is treatment for alcohol use disorder effective?For most people; treatment for an AUD is helpful. But overcoming an alcohol use disorder is an ongoing process; and you may relapse (start drinking again). You should look at relapse as a temporary setback; and keep trying. Many people repeatedly try to cut back or quit drinking; have a setback; then try to quit again. Having a relapse does not mean that you cannot recover. If you do relapse; it is important to return to treatment right away; so you can learn more about your relapse triggers and improve your coping skills. This may help you be more successful the next time.NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

Fatty Liver Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/fattyliverdisease.html,What is fatty liver disease?Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons. Fatty liver disease is a condition in which fat builds up in your liver. There are two main types:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)Alcoholic fatty liver disease; also called alcoholic steatohepatitisWhat is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)?NAFLD is a type of fatty liver disease that is not related to heavy alcohol use. There are two kinds:Simple fatty liver; in which you have fat in your liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Simple fatty liver typically does not get bad enough to cause liver damage or complications.Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage; as well as fat in your liver. Inflammation and liver cell damage can cause fibrosis; or scarring; of the liver. NASH may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.What is alcoholic fatty liver disease?Alcoholic fatty liver disease is due to heavy alcohol use. Your liver breaks down most of the alcohol you drink; so it can be removed from your body. But the process of breaking it down can generate harmful substances. These substances can damage liver cells; promote inflammation; and weaken your body's natural defenses. The more alcohol that you drink; the more you damage your liver.  Alcoholic fatty liver disease is the earliest stage of alcohol-related liver disease. The next stages are alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.Who gets fatty liver disease?Researchers do not know the cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). They do know that it is more common in people whoHave type 2 diabetes and prediabetesHave obesityAre middle aged or older (although children can also get it)Are Hispanic; followed by non-Hispanic whites. It is less common in African Americans.Have high levels of fats in the blood; such as cholesterol and triglyceridesHave high blood pressureTake certain drugs; such as corticosteroids and some cancer drugsHave certain metabolic disorders; including metabolic syndromeHave rapid weight lossHave certain infections; such as hepatitis CHave been exposed to some toxinsNAFLD affects about 25 percent of people in the world. As the rates of obesity; type 2 diabetes; and high cholesterol are rising in the United States; so is the rate of NAFLD. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disorder in the United States.Alcoholic fatty liver disease only happens in people who are heavy drinkers; especially those who have been drinking for a long period of time. The risk is higher for heavy drinkers who are women; have obesity; or have certain genetic mutations.What are the symptoms of fatty liver disease?Both NAFLD and alcoholic fatty liver disease are usually silent diseases with few or no symptoms. If you do have symptoms; you may feel tired or have discomfort in the upper right side of your abdomen.How do I know if I have fatty liver disease?Because there are often no symptoms; it is not easy to find fatty liver disease. Your doctor may suspect that you have it if you get abnormal results on liver tests that you had for other reasons. To make a diagnosis; your doctor will useYour medical historyA physical examVarious tests; including blood and imaging tests; and sometimes a biopsyAs part of the medical history; your doctor will ask about your alcohol use; to find out whether fat in your liver is a sign of alcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). He or she will also ask which medicines you take; to try to determine whether a medicine is causing your NAFLD.During the physical exam; your doctor will examine your body and check your weight and height. Your doctor will look for signs of fatty liver disease; such asAn enlarged liverSigns of cirrhosis; such as jaundice; a condition that causes your skin and whites of your eyes to turn yellowYou will likely have blood tests; including liver function tests and blood count tests. In some cases you may also have imaging tests; like those that check for fat in the liver and the stiffness of your liver. Liver stiffness can mean fibrosis; which is scarring of the liver. In some cases you may also need a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis; and to check how bad the liver damage is.What are the treatments for fatty liver disease?Doctors recommend weight loss for nonalcoholic fatty liver. Weight loss can reduce fat in the liver; inflammation; and fibrosis. If your doctor thinks that a certain medicine is the cause of your NAFLD; you should stop taking that medicine.  But check with your doctor before stopping the medicine. You may need to get off the medicine gradually; and you might need to switch to another medicine instead.There are no medicines that have been approved to treat NAFLD. Studies are investigating whether a certain diabetes medicine or Vitamin E can help; but more studies are needed.The most important part of treating alcohol-related fatty liver disease is to stop drinking alcohol. If you need help doing that; you may want to see a therapist or participate in an alcohol recovery program. There are also medicines that can help; either by reducing your cravings or making you feel sick if you drink alcohol.Both alcoholic fatty liver disease and one type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) can lead to cirrhosis. Doctors can treat the health problems caused by cirrhosis with medicines; operations; and other medical procedures. If the cirrhosis leads to liver failure; you may need a liver transplant.What are some lifestyle changes that can help with fatty liver disease?If you have any of the types of fatty liver disease; there are some lifestyle changes that can help:Eat a healthy diet; limiting salt and sugar; plus eating lots of fruits; vegetables; and whole grainsGet vaccinations for hepatitis A and B; the flu and pneumococcal disease. If you get hepatitis A or B along with fatty liver; it is more likely to lead to liver failure. People with chronic liver disease are more likely to get infections; so the other two vaccinations are also important.Get regular exercise; which can help you lose weight and reduce fat in the liverTalk with your doctor before using dietary supplements; such as vitamins; or any complementary or alternative medicines or medical practices. Some herbal remedies can damage your liver.

Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia,https://medlineplus.gov/acutelymphocyticleukemia.html,Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infection. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. In leukemia; however; the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells; making it hard for blood to do its work. In acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL); also called acute lymphoblastic leukemia; there are too many of specific types of white blood cells called lymphocytes or lymphoblasts.  ALL is the most common type of cancer in children.Possible risk factors for ALL include being male; being white; previous chemotherapy treatment; exposure to radiation; and for adults; being older than 70.Symptoms of ALL include:Weakness or feeling tiredFeverEasy bruising or bleedingBleeding under the skinShortness of breathWeight loss or loss of appetitePain in the bones or stomachPain or a feeling of fullness below the ribsPainless lumps in the neck; underarm; stomach; or groinTests that examine the blood and bone marrow diagnose ALL. Treatments include chemotherapy; radiation therapy; stem cell transplants; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. Once the leukemia is in remission; you need additional treatment to make sure that it does not come back.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Aspergillosis,https://medlineplus.gov/aspergillosis.html,Aspergillosis is a disease caused by a fungus (or mold) called Aspergillus.  The fungus is very common in both indoors and outdoors. Most people breathe in the spores of the fungus every day without being affected. But some people get the disease. It usually occurs in people with lung diseases or weakened immune systems.There are different kinds of aspergillosis. One kind is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (also called ABPA).  Symptoms of ABPA include wheezing and coughing. ABPA can affect healthy people but it is most common in people with asthma or cystic fibrosis.Another kind is invasive aspergillosis; which damages tissues in the body. It usually affects the lungs. Sometimes it can also cause infection in other organs and spread throughout the body. It affects people who have immune system problems; such as people who have had a transplant; are taking high doses of steroids; or getting chemotherapy for some cancers.Your doctor might do a variety of tests to make the diagnosis; including a chest x-ray; CT scan of the lungs; and  an examination of tissues for signs of the fungus. Treatment is with antifungal drugs. If you have ABPA; you may also take steroids.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Allergy,https://medlineplus.gov/allergy.html,An allergy is a reaction by your immune system to something that does not bother most other people. People who have allergies often are sensitive to more than one thing. Substances that often cause reactions arePollenDust mitesMold sporesPet danderFoodInsect stingsMedicinesNormally; your immune system fights germs. It is your body's defense system. In most allergic reactions; however; it is responding to a false alarm. Genes and the environment probably both play a role.Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms such as a runny nose; sneezing; itching; rashes; swelling; or asthma. Allergies can range from minor to severe.  Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction that can be life-threatening.   Doctors use skin and blood tests to diagnose allergies. Treatments include medicines; allergy shots; and avoiding the substances that cause the reactions.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Hay Fever,https://medlineplus.gov/hayfever.html,Each spring; summer; and fall; trees; weeds; and grasses release tiny pollen grains into the air. Some of the pollen ends up in your nose and throat. This can trigger a type of allergy called hay fever.Symptoms can includeSneezing; often with a runny or clogged noseCoughing and postnasal dripItching eyes; nose and throatRed and watery eyesDark circles under the eyesYour health care provider may diagnose hay fever based on a physical exam and your symptoms. Sometimes skin or blood tests are used. Taking medicines and using nasal sprays can relieve symptoms. You can also rinse out your nose; but be sure to use distilled or sterilized water with saline. Allergy shots can help make you less sensitive to pollen and provide long-term relief.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Allergy,https://medlineplus.gov/allergy.html,An allergy is a reaction by your immune system to something that does not bother most other people. People who have allergies often are sensitive to more than one thing. Substances that often cause reactions arePollenDust mitesMold sporesPet danderFoodInsect stingsMedicinesNormally; your immune system fights germs. It is your body's defense system. In most allergic reactions; however; it is responding to a false alarm. Genes and the environment probably both play a role.Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms such as a runny nose; sneezing; itching; rashes; swelling; or asthma. Allergies can range from minor to severe.  Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction that can be life-threatening.   Doctors use skin and blood tests to diagnose allergies. Treatments include medicines; allergy shots; and avoiding the substances that cause the reactions.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Food Allergy,https://medlineplus.gov/foodallergy.html,Food allergy is an abnormal response to a food triggered by your body's immune system.In adults; the foods that most often trigger allergic reactions include fish; shellfish; peanuts; and tree nuts; such as walnuts. Problem foods for children can include eggs; milk; peanuts; tree nuts; soy; and wheat.The allergic reaction may be mild. In rare cases it can cause a severe reaction called anaphylaxis. Symptoms of food allergy includeItching or swelling in your mouthVomiting; diarrhea; or abdominal cramps and painHives or eczemaTightening of the throat and trouble breathingDrop in blood pressureYour health care provider may use a detailed history; elimination diet; and skin and blood tests to diagnose a food allergy.When you have food allergies; you must be prepared to treat an accidental exposure. Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace; and carry an auto-injector device containing epinephrine (adrenaline).You can only prevent the symptoms of food allergy by avoiding the food. After you and your health care provider have identified the foods to which you are sensitive; you must remove them from your diet.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Latex Allergy,https://medlineplus.gov/latexallergy.html,Latex is a milky fluid that comes from the tropical rubber tree. Hundreds of everyday products contain latex. Repeated exposure to a protein in natural latex can make you more likely to develop a latex allergy. If your immune system detects the protein; a reaction can start in minutes. You could get a rash or asthma. In rare cases you could have a severe reaction called anaphylaxis.Your doctor may use a physical exam and skin and blood tests to diagnose it. There are medicines to treat a reaction; but it is best to try to avoid latex. Common latex products includeGlovesCondomsBalloonsRubber bandsShoe solesPacifiersYou can find latex-free versions of these products.
Hair Loss,https://medlineplus.gov/hairloss.html,You lose up to 100 hairs from your scalp every day. That's normal; and in most people; those hairs grow back. But many men -- and some women -- lose hair as they grow older. You can also lose your hair if you have certain diseases; such as thyroid problems; diabetes; or lupus. If you take certain medicines or have chemotherapy for cancer; you may also lose your hair. Other causes are stress; a low protein diet; a family history; or poor nutrition. Treatment for hair loss depends on the cause. In some cases; treating the underlying cause will correct the problem. Other treatments include medicines and hair restoration.
Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency,https://medlineplus.gov/alpha1antitrypsindeficiency.html,Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency) is an inherited condition that raises your risk for lung and liver disease.  Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a protein that protects the lungs. The liver makes it. If the AAT proteins aren't the right shape; they get stuck in the liver cells and can't reach the lungs.Symptoms of AAT deficiency includeShortness of breath and wheezingRepeated lung infectionsTirednessRapid heartbeat upon standingVision problemsWeight lossSome people have no symptoms and do not develop complications.Blood tests and genetic tests can tell if you have it.  If your lungs are affected; you may also have lung tests. Treatments include medicines; pulmonary rehab; and extra oxygen; if needed. Severe cases may need a lung transplant.  Not smoking can prevent or delay lung symptoms.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Vitamin E,https://medlineplus.gov/vitamine.html,Vitamins are substances that your body needs to grow and develop normally. Vitamin E is an antioxidant. It plays a role in your immune system and metabolic processes.Good sources of vitamin E includeVegetable oilsMargarineNuts and seedsLeafy greensVitamin E is also added to foods like cereals. Most people get enough vitamin E from the foods they eat. People with certain disorders; such as liver diseases; cystic fibrosis; and Crohn's disease may need extra vitamin E. Vitamin E supplements may be harmful for people who take blood thinners and other medicines. Check with your health care provider before taking the supplements.NIH: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,https://medlineplus.gov/amyotrophiclateralsclerosis.html,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a nervous system disease that attacks nerve cells called neurons in your brain and spinal cord. These neurons transmit messages from your brain and spinal cord to your voluntary muscles - the ones you can control; like in your arms and legs. At first; this causes mild muscle problems. Some people noticeTrouble walking or running Trouble writing Speech problemsEventually; you lose your strength and cannot move. When muscles in your chest fail; you cannot breathe. A breathing machine can help; but most people with ALS die from respiratory failure. The disease usually strikes between age 40 and 60. More men than women get it. No one knows what causes ALS. It can run in families; but usually it strikes at random. There is no cure. Medicines can relieve symptoms and; sometimes; prolong survival. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Complementary and Integrative Medicine,https://medlineplus.gov/complementaryandintegrativemedicine.html,Many Americans use medical treatments that are not part of mainstream medicine. When you are using these types of care; it may be called complementary; integrative; or alternative medicine.Complementary medicine is used together with mainstream medical care. An example is using acupuncture to help with side effects of cancer treatment. When health care providers and facilities offer both types of care; it is called integrative medicine. Alternative medicine is used instead of mainstream medical care.The claims that non-mainstream practitioners make can sound promising. However; researchers do not know how safe many of these treatments are or how well they work. Studies are underway to determine the safety and usefulness of many of these practices.To minimize the health risks of a non-mainstream treatmentDiscuss it with your doctor. It might have side effects or interact with other medicines.Find out what the research says about itChoose practitioners carefullyTell all of your doctors and practitioners about all of the different types of treatments you useNIH: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health
Cancer Alternative Therapies,https://medlineplus.gov/canceralternativetherapies.html,You have many choices to make about your cancer treatment. One choice you might be thinking about is complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM is the term for medical products and practices that are not part of standard care.  Examples of CAM therapies are acupuncture; chiropractic; and herbal medicines.People with cancer may use CAM toHelp cope with the side effects of cancer treatmentsEase worries of cancer treatment and related stressFeel that they are doing something more to help their own careCAM treatments do not work for everyone. Some methods; such as acupuncture; might help with nausea; pain and other side effects of cancer treatment.  Talk to your doctor to make sure that all aspects of your cancer care work together.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Alzheimer's Caregivers,https://medlineplus.gov/alzheimerscaregivers.html,Caring for someone who has Alzheimer's disease  (AD) can be stressful and overwhelming. It's important to take care of yourself. Ask for and accept help. Talk to the doctor. Find out what treatments might help control symptoms or address behavior problems. Find a support group. Others who have "been there" may be able to help and will understand.  If there are times of day that the person is less confused or more cooperative; take advantage of that in daily routines. Consider using adult day care or respite services. These offer a break with the peace of mind that the patient is being taken care of.  Begin to plan for the future. This may include   Getting financial and legal documents in order  Looking into assisted living or nursing homes Finding out what your health insurance and Medicare will cover  NIH: National Institute on Aging
Alzheimer's Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/alzheimersdisease.html,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among older people. Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects a person's ability to carry out daily activities. AD begins slowly. It first involves the parts of the brain that control thought; memory and language. People with AD may have trouble remembering things that happened recently or names of people they know. A related problem; mild cognitive impairment (MCI); causes more memory problems than normal for people of the same age.  Many; but not all; people with MCI will develop AD.In AD; over time; symptoms get worse. People may not recognize family members. They may have trouble speaking; reading or writing. They may forget how to brush their teeth or comb their hair. Later on; they may become anxious or aggressive; or wander away from home. Eventually; they need total care. This can cause great stress for family members who must care for them.AD usually begins after age 60.  The risk goes up as you get older. Your risk is also higher if a family member has had the disease. No treatment can stop the disease. However; some drugs may help keep symptoms from getting worse for a limited time.NIH: National Institute on Aging
Amblyopia,https://medlineplus.gov/amblyopia.html, Amblyopia; or "lazy eye;" is the most common cause of visual impairment in children.  It happens when an eye fails to work properly with the brain.  The eye may look normal; but the brain favors the other eye.   In some cases; it can affect both eyes.  Causes includeStrabismus - a disorder in which the two eyes don't line up in the same directionRefractive error in an eye - when one eye cannot focus as well as the other; because of a problem with its shape.  This includes nearsightedness; farsightedness; and astigmatism.Cataract - a clouding in the lens of the eyeIt can be hard to diagnose amblyopia.  It is often found during a routine vision exam.Treatment for amblyopia forces the child to use the eye with weaker vision.  There are two common ways to do this.  One is to have the child wear a patch over the good eye for several hours each day; over a number of weeks to months.  The other is with eye drops that temporarily blur vision.  Each day; the child gets a drop of a drug called atropine in the stronger eye.  It is also sometimes necessary to treat the underlying cause.  This could include glasses or surgery.NIH: National Eye Institute
Macular Degeneration,https://medlineplus.gov/maculardegeneration.html,Macular degeneration; or age-related macular degeneration (AMD); is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. It is a disease that destroys your sharp; central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving. AMD affects the macula; the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt; but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked.Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision.NIH: National Eye Institute
Menstruation,https://medlineplus.gov/menstruation.html,Menstruation; or period; is normal vaginal bleeding that occurs as part of a woman's monthly cycle. Every month; your body prepares for pregnancy. If no pregnancy occurs; the uterus; or womb; sheds its lining. The menstrual blood is partly blood and partly tissue from inside the uterus. It passes out of the body through the vagina. Periods usually start between age 11 and 14 and continue until menopause at about age 51. They usually last from three to five days. Besides bleeding from the vagina; you may haveAbdominal or pelvic cramping painLower back painBloating and sore breastsFood cravingsMood swings and irritabilityHeadache and fatiguePremenstrual syndrome; or PMS; is a group of symptoms that start before the period. It can include emotional and physical symptoms.Consult your health care provider if you have big changes in your cycle. They may be signs of other problems that should be treated.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development

Amino Acid Metabolism Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/aminoacidmetabolismdisorders.html,Metabolism is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Food is made up of proteins; carbohydrates; and fats. Your digestive system breaks the food parts down into sugars and acids; your body's fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away; or it can store the energy in your body. If you have a metabolic disorder; something goes wrong with this process.One group of these disorders is amino acid metabolism disorders. They include phenylketonuria (PKU) and maple syrup urine disease. Amino acids are "building blocks" that join together to form proteins. If you have one of these disorders; your body may have trouble breaking down certain amino acids. Or there may be a problem getting the amino acids into your cells. These problems cause a buildup of harmful substances in your body. That can lead to serious; sometimes life-threatening; health problems.These disorders are usually inherited. A baby who is born with one may not have any symptoms right away. Because the disorders can be so serious; early diagnosis and treatment are critical. Newborn babies get screened for many of them; using blood tests.Treatments may include special diets; medicines; and supplements.  Some babies may also need additional treatments if there are complications.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia,https://medlineplus.gov/acutemyeloidleukemia.html,Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infection. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. In leukemia; however; the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells; making it hard for blood to do its work. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML); there are too many of a specific type of white blood cell called a myeloblast.AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated. Possible risk factors include smoking; previous chemotherapy treatment; and exposure to radiation. Symptoms of AML include:FeverShortness of breathEasy bruising or bleedingBleeding under the skinWeakness or feeling tiredWeight loss or loss of appetiteTests that examine the blood and bone marrow diagnose AML. Treatments include chemotherapy; other drugs; radiation therapy; stem cell transplants; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. Once the leukemia is in remission; you need additional treatment to make sure that it does not come back.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Memory,https://medlineplus.gov/memory.html,Every day; you have different experiences and you learn new things. Your brain cannot store all of that information; so it has to decide what is worth remembering. Memory is the process of storing and then remembering this information. There are different types of memory. Short-term memory stores information for a few seconds or minutes. Long-term memory stores it for a longer period of time.Memory doesn't always work perfectly. As you grow older; it may take longer to remember things.It's normal to forget things once in awhile. We've all forgotten a name; where we put our keys; or if we locked the front door. If you are a senior who forget things more often than others your age; you may have mild cognitive impairment. Forgetting how to use your phone or find your way home may be signs of a more serious problem; such asAlzheimer's diseaseOther types of dementiaStrokeDepressionHead injuriesBlood clots or tumors in the brainKidney; liver; or thyroid problemsReactions to certain medicinesIf you're worried about your forgetfulness; see your health care provider.NIH: National Institute on Aging
Prenatal Testing,https://medlineplus.gov/prenataltesting.html,Prenatal testing provides information about your baby's health before he or she is born. Some routine tests during pregnancy also check on your health. At your first prenatal visit; your health care provider will test for a number of things; including problems with your blood; signs of infections; and whether you are immune to rubella (German measles) and chickenpox.Throughout your pregnancy; your health care provider may suggest a number of other tests; too. Some tests are suggested for all women; such as screenings for gestational diabetes; Down syndrome; and HIV. Other tests might be offered based on your:AgePersonal or family health historyEthnic backgroundResults of routine testsSome tests are screening tests. They detect risks for or signs of possible health problems in you or your baby. Based on screening test results; your doctor might suggest diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests confirm or rule out health problems in you or your baby. Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Club Drugs,https://medlineplus.gov/clubdrugs.html,Club drugs are group of psychoactive drugs.  They act on the central nervous system and can cause changes in mood; awareness; and how you act. These drugs are often abused by young adults at all-night dance parties; dance clubs; and bars.

Other uses of these drugs are abuse.Club drugs are also sometimes used as "date rape" drugs; to make someone unable to say no to or fight back against sexual assault. Abusing these drugs can cause serious health problems and sometimes death. They are even more dangerous if you use them with alcohol. NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Methamphetamine,https://medlineplus.gov/methamphetamine.html,Methamphetamine - meth for short - is a very addictive stimulant drug.  It is a powder that can be made into a pill or a shiny rock (called a crystal). The powder can be eaten or snorted up the nose. It can also be mixed with liquid and injected into your body with a needle. Crystal meth is smoked in a small glass pipe.Meth at first causes a rush of good feelings; but then users feel edgy; overly excited; angry; or afraid.  Meth use can quickly lead to addiction. It causes medical problems includingMaking your body temperature so high that you pass outSevere itching"Meth mouth" - broken teeth and dry mouthThinking and emotional problemsNIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Artificial Limbs,https://medlineplus.gov/artificiallimbs.html,People can lose all or part of an arm or leg for a number of reasons. Common ones includeCirculation problems from atherosclerosis or diabetes. They may cause you to need an amputation.Traumatic injuries; including from traffic accidents and military combatCancerBirth defectsIf you are missing an arm or leg; an artificial limb can sometimes replace it.  The device; which is called a prosthesis; can help you to perform daily activities such as walking; eating; or dressing. Some artificial limbs let you function nearly as well as before.
Limb Loss,https://medlineplus.gov/limbloss.html,People can lose all or part of an arm or leg for a number of reasons. Common ones includeProblems with blood circulation. These may be the result of atherosclerosis or diabetes. Severe cases may result in amputation.Injuries; including from traffic accidents and military combatCancerBirth defectsSome amputees have phantom pain; which is the feeling of pain in the missing limb. Other physical problems include surgical complications and skin problems; if you wear an artificial limb. Many amputees use an artificial limb. Learning how to use it takes time. Physical therapy can help you adapt.Recovery from the loss of a limb can be hard. Sadness; anger; and frustration are common.  If you are having a tough time; talk to your doctor. Treatment with medicine or counseling can help.
Amyloidosis,https://medlineplus.gov/amyloidosis.html,Amyloidosis occurs when abnormal proteins called amyloids build up and form deposits. The deposits can collect in organs such as the kidney and heart. This can cause the organs to become stiff and unable to work the way they should. There are three main types of amyloidosis:Primary - with no known causeSecondary - caused by another disease; including some types of cancerFamilial - passed down through genesSymptoms can vary; depending upon which organs are affected. Treatment depends on the type of amyloidosis you have.  The goal is to help with symptoms and limit the production of proteins. If another disease is the cause; it needs to be treated.

Anal Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/analcancer.html,The anus is where stool leaves your body when you go to the bathroom. It is made up of your outer layers of skin and the end of your large intestine. Anal cancer is a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the anus.Anal cancer is rare. It is more common in smokers and people over 50. You are also at higher risk if you have HPV; have anal sex; or have many sexual partners.Symptoms include bleeding; pain; or lumps in the anal area. Anal itching and discharge can also be signs of anal cancer.Doctors use tests that examine the anus to diagnose anal cancer. They include a physical exam; endoscopy; ultrasound; and biopsy.Treatments include radiation therapy; chemotherapy; and surgery.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Anal Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/analdisorders.html,The anus is the opening of the rectum through which stool passes out of your body. Problems with the anus are common. They include hemorrhoids; abscesses; fissures (cracks); and cancer.You may be embarrassed to talk about your anal troubles. But it is important to let your doctor know; especially if you have pain or bleeding. The more details you can give about your problem; the better your doctor will be able to help you. Treatments vary depending on the particular problem.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Pain Relievers,https://medlineplus.gov/painrelievers.html,Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve headaches; sore muscles; arthritis; or other aches and pains.  There are many different pain medicines; and each one has advantages and risks. Some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others. Each person may also have a slightly different response to a pain reliever. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are good for many types of pain. There are two main types of OTC pain medicines: acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin; naproxen (Aleve); and ibuprofen (Advil; Motrin) are examples of OTC NSAIDs.If OTC medicines don't relieve your pain; your doctor may prescribe something stronger. Many NSAIDs are also available at higher prescription doses. The most powerful pain relievers are opioids. They are very effective; but they can sometimes have serious side effects. There is also a risk of addiction. Because of the risks; you must use them only under a doctor's supervision.There are many things you can do to help ease pain. Pain relievers are just one part of a pain treatment plan.

Anemia,https://medlineplus.gov/anemia.html,If you have anemia; your blood does not carry enough oxygen to the rest of your body.  The most common cause of anemia is not having enough iron. Your body needs iron to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives the red color to blood. It carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.Anemia has three main causes: blood loss; lack of red blood cell production; and high rates of red blood cell destruction.Conditions that may lead to anemia includeHeavy periodsPregnancyUlcersColon polyps or colon cancerInherited disordersA diet that does not have enough iron; folic acid or vitamin B12Blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia; or cancerAplastic anemia; a condition that can be inherited or acquiredG6PD deficiency; a metabolic disorderAnemia can make you feel tired; cold; dizzy; and irritable.

Neural Tube Defects,https://medlineplus.gov/neuraltubedefects.html,Neural tube defects are birth defects of the brain; spine; or spinal cord. They happen in the first month of pregnancy; often before a woman even knows that she is pregnant. The two most common neural tube defects are spina bifida and anencephaly. In spina bifida; the fetal spinal column doesn't close completely. There is usually nerve damage that causes at least some paralysis of the legs. In anencephaly; most of the brain and skull do not develop. Babies with anencephaly are usually either stillborn or die shortly after birth. Another type of defect; Chiari malformation; causes the brain tissue to extend into the spinal canal.The exact causes of neural tube defects aren't known. You're at greater risk of having an infant with a neural tube defect if youHave obesityHave poorly controlled diabetesTake certain antiseizure medicinesGetting enough folic acid; a type of B vitamin; before and during pregnancy prevents most neural tube defects.Neural tube defects are usually diagnosed before the infant is born; through lab or imaging tests. There is no cure for neural tube defects. The nerve damage and loss of function that are present at birth are usually permanent. However; a variety of treatments can sometimes prevent further damage and help with complications.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Anesthesia,https://medlineplus.gov/anesthesia.html,If you are having surgery; your doctor will give you medicine called an anesthetic. Anesthetics reduce or prevent pain. There are three main types:Local - numbs one small area of the body. You stay awake and alert.Regional - blocks pain in an area of the body; such an arm or leg. A common type is epidural anesthesia; which is often used during childbirth.General - makes you unconscious. You do not feel any pain; and you do not remember the procedure afterwards.You may also get a mild sedative to relax you. You stay awake but may not remember the procedure afterwards. Sedation can be used with or without anesthesia.The type of anesthesia or sedation you get depends on many factors. They include the procedure you are having and your current health.
Aneurysms,https://medlineplus.gov/aneurysms.html,An aneurysm is a bulge or "ballooning" in the wall of an artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to other parts of the body. If an aneurysm grows large; it can burst and cause dangerous bleeding or even death. Most aneurysms occur in the aorta; the main artery that runs from the heart through the chest and abdomen. Aneurysms also can happen in arteries in the brain; heart and other parts of the body. If an aneurysm in the brain bursts; it causes a stroke.Aneurysms can develop and become large before causing any symptoms.  Often doctors can stop aneurysms from bursting if they find and treat them early. They use imaging tests to find aneurysms.  Often aneurysms are found by chance during tests done for other reasons.   Medicines and surgery are the two main treatments for aneurysms. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Vasculitis,https://medlineplus.gov/vasculitis.html,Vasculitis is an inflammation of the blood vessels. It happens when the body's immune system attacks the blood vessel by mistake. It can happen because of an infection; a medicine; or another disease. The cause is often unknown.Vasculitis can affect arteries; veins and capillaries. Arteries are vessels that carry blood from the heart to the body's organs. Veins are the vessels that carry blood back to the heart. Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that connect the small arteries and veins. When a blood vessel becomes inflamed; it can Narrow; making it more difficult for blood to get through  Close off completely so that blood can't get through  Stretch and weaken so much that it bulges.  The bulge is called an aneurysm. If it  bursts; it can cause dangerous bleeding inside the body.Symptoms of vasculitis can vary; but usually include fever; swelling and a general sense of feeling ill. The main goal of treatment is to stop the inflammation. Steroids and other medicines to stop inflammation are often helpful.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Angina,https://medlineplus.gov/angina.html,Angina is chest pain or discomfort you feel when there is not enough blood flow to your heart muscle. Your heart muscle needs the oxygen that the blood carries. Angina may feel like pressure or a squeezing pain in your chest. It may feel like indigestion. You may also feel pain in your shoulders; arms; neck; jaw; or back. Angina is a symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD); the most common heart disease. CAD happens when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to the heart; reducing blood flow.There are three types of angina:Stable angina is the most common type. It happens when the heart is working harder than usual. Stable angina has a regular pattern.  Rest and medicines usually help.Unstable angina is the most dangerous. It does not follow a pattern and can happen without physical exertion. It does not go away with rest or medicine. It is a sign that you could have a heart attack soon.Variant angina is rare. It happens when you are resting. Medicines can help.Not all chest pain or discomfort is angina.  If you have chest pain; you should see your health care provider.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Angioplasty,https://medlineplus.gov/angioplasty.html,If you have coronary artery disease; the arteries in your heart are narrowed or blocked by a sticky material called plaque. Angioplasty is a procedure to restore blood flow through the artery.You have angioplasty in a hospital. The doctor threads a thin tube through a blood vessel in the arm or groin up to the involved site in the artery. The tube has a tiny balloon on the end. When the tube is in place; the doctor inflates the balloon to push the plaque outward against the wall of the artery.

Peripheral Arterial Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/peripheralarterialdisease.html,Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) happens when there is a narrowing of the blood vessels outside of your heart. The cause of PAD is atherosclerosis. This happens when plaque builds up on the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the arms and legs. Plaque is a substance made up of fat and cholesterol. It causes the arteries to narrow or become blocked. This can reduce or stop blood flow; usually to the legs. If severe enough; blocked blood flow can cause tissue death and can sometimes lead to amputation of the foot or leg.The main risk factor for PAD is smoking. Other risk factors include older age and diseases like diabetes; high blood cholesterol; high blood pressure; heart disease; and stroke.Many people who have PAD don't have any symptoms. If you have symptoms; they may includePain; numbness; achiness; or heaviness in the leg muscles. This happens when walking or climbing stairs.Weak or absent pulses in the legs or feetSores or wounds on the toes; feet; or legs that heal slowly; poorly; or not at allA pale or bluish color to the skinA lower temperature in one leg than the other legPoor nail growth on the toes and decreased hair growth on the legsErectile dysfunction; especially among men who have diabetesPAD can increase your risk of heart attack; stroke; and transient ischemic attack.Doctors diagnose PAD with a physical exam and heart and imaging tests. Treatments include lifestyle changes; medicines; and sometimes surgery. Lifestyle changes include dietary changes; exercise; and efforts to lower high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Coronary Artery Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/coronaryarterydisease.html,Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease. It is the leading cause of death in the United States in both men and women.CAD happens when the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material; called plaque; on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows; less blood can flow through the arteries. As a result; the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack.  Most heart attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the hearts' blood supply; causing permanent heart damage.  Over time; CAD can also weaken the heart muscle and contribute to heart failure and arrhythmias. Heart failure means the heart can't pump blood well to the rest of the body. Arrhythmias are changes in the normal beating rhythm of the heart.  NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Arteriovenous Malformations,https://medlineplus.gov/arteriovenousmalformations.html,Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are defects in your vascular system. The vascular system includes arteries; veins; and capillaries. Arteries carry blood away from the heart to other organs; veins carry blood back to the heart. Capillaries connect the arteries and veins.  An AVM is a snarled tangle of arteries and veins. They are connected to each other; with no capillaries. That interferes with the blood circulation in an organ.AVMs can happen anywhere; but they are more common in the brain or spinal cord. Most people with brain or spinal cord AVMs have few; if any; major symptoms. Sometimes they can cause seizures or headaches.AVMs are rare. The cause is not known; but they seem to develop during pregnancy or soon after birth. Doctors use imaging tests to detect them.Medicines can help with the symptoms from AVMs. The greatest danger is hemorrhage. Treatment for AVMs can include surgery or focused radiation therapy. Because surgery can be risky; you and your doctor need to make a decision carefully.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Arthritis,https://medlineplus.gov/arthritis.html,If you feel pain and stiffness in your body or have trouble moving around; you might have arthritis. Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet; such as your elbow or knee. Over time; a swollen joint can become severely damaged. Some kinds of arthritis can also cause problems in your organs; such as your eyes or skin.Types of arthritis includeOsteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It's often related to aging or to an injury.Autoimmune arthritis happens when your body's immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common form of this kind of arthritis.Juvenile arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens in  children.Infectious arthritis is an infection that has spread from another part of the body to the joint.Psoriatic arthritis affects people with psoriasis.Gout is a painful type of arthritis that happens when too much uric acid builds up in the body. It often starts in the big toe.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Joint Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/jointdisorders.html,A joint is where two or more bones come together; like the knee; hip; elbow; or shoulder. Joints can be damaged by many types of injuries or diseases; includingArthritis - inflammation of a joint.  It causes pain; stiffness; and swelling. Over time; the joint can become severely damaged.Bursitis - inflammation of a fluid-filled sac that cushions the jointDislocations - injuries that force the ends of the bones out of positionTreatment of joint problems depends on the cause. If you have a sports injury; treatment often begins with the RICE (Rest; Ice; Compression; and Elevation) method to relieve pain; reduce swelling; and speed healing. Other possible treatments include pain relievers; keeping the injured area from moving; rehabilitation; and sometimes surgery. For arthritis; injuries; or other diseases; you may need joint replacement surgery to remove the damaged joint and put in a new one.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Hip Replacement,https://medlineplus.gov/hipreplacement.html,Hip replacement is surgery for people with severe hip damage. The most common cause of damage is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis causes pain; swelling; and reduced motion in your joints. It can interfere with your daily activities. If other treatments such as physical therapy; pain medicines; and exercise haven't helped; hip replacement surgery might be an option for you.During a hip replacement operation; the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from your hip joint and replaces them with new; man-made parts.A hip replacement canRelieve painHelp your hip joint work betterImprove walking and other movementsThe most common problem after surgery is hip dislocation. Because a man-made hip is smaller than the original joint; the ball can come out of its socket. The surgery can also cause blood clots and infections. With a hip replacement; you might need to avoid certain activities; such as jogging and high-impact sports.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases

Knee Replacement,https://medlineplus.gov/kneereplacement.html,Knee replacement is surgery for people with severe knee damage. Knee replacement can relieve pain and allow you to be more active. Your doctor may recommend it if you have knee pain and medicine and other treatments are not helping you anymore.When you have a total knee replacement; the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from the surface of your knee joint and replaces them with a man-made surface of metal and plastic. In a partial knee replacement; the surgeon only replaces one part of your knee joint.  The surgery can cause scarring; blood clots; and; rarely; infections. After a knee replacement; you will no longer be able to do certain activities; such as jogging and high-impact sports.

You may need it if you Can't swallowHave problems with your appetiteAre severely malnourishedCan't absorb nutrients through your digestive systemYou receive nutritional support through a needle or catheter placed in your vein or with a feeding tube; which goes into your stomach.
Infertility,https://medlineplus.gov/infertility.html,Infertility means not being able to become pregnant after a year of trying. If a woman can get pregnant but keeps having miscarriages or stillbirths; that's also called infertility.Infertility is fairly common. After one year of having unprotected sex; about 15 percent of couples are unable to get pregnant. About a third of the time; infertility can be traced to the woman. In another third of cases; it is because of the man. The rest of the time; it is because of both partners or no cause can be found.There are treatments that are specifically for men or for women. Some involve both partners. Drugs; assisted reproductive technology; and surgery are common treatments. Happily; many couples treated for infertility go on to have babies.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Cataract,https://medlineplus.gov/cataract.html,A cataract is a clouding of the lens in your eye.  It affects your vision.  Cataracts are very common in older people. By age 80; more than half of all Americans either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery.A cataract can occur in either or both eyes. It cannot spread from one eye to the other. Common symptoms areBlurry visionColors that seem fadedGlare - headlights; lamps or sunlight may seem too bright. You may also see a halo around lights.Not being able to see well at nightDouble vision Frequent prescription changes in your eye wear Cataracts usually develop slowly. New glasses; brighter lighting; anti-glare sunglasses or magnifying lenses can help at first. Surgery is also an option. It involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. Wearing sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block ultraviolet sunlight may help to delay cataracts.NIH: National Eye Institute
Refractive Errors,https://medlineplus.gov/refractiveerrors.html,The cornea and lens of your eye helps you focus.  Refractive errors are vision problems that happen when the shape of the eye keeps you from focusing well. The cause could be the length of the eyeball (longer or shorter); changes in the shape of the cornea; or aging of the lens.Four common refractive errors areMyopia; or nearsightedness - clear vision close up but  blurry in the distanceHyperopia; or farsightedness - clear vision in the distance but blurry close upPresbyopia - inability to focus close up as a result of agingAstigmatism - focus problems caused by the corneaThe most common symptom is blurred vision. Other symptoms may include double vision; haziness; glare or halos around bright lights; squinting; headaches; or eye strain.Glasses or contact lenses can usually correct refractive errors. Laser eye surgery may also be a possibility.NIH: National Eye Institute
Artificial Limbs,https://medlineplus.gov/artificiallimbs.html,People can lose all or part of an arm or leg for a number of reasons. Common ones includeCirculation problems from atherosclerosis or diabetes. They may cause you to need an amputation.Traumatic injuries; including from traffic accidents and military combatCancerBirth defectsIf you are missing an arm or leg; an artificial limb can sometimes replace it.  The device; which is called a prosthesis; can help you to perform daily activities such as walking; eating; or dressing. Some artificial limbs let you function nearly as well as before.
Asbestos,https://medlineplus.gov/asbestos.html,Asbestos is the name of a group of minerals with long; thin fibers. It was once used widely as insulation. It also occurs in the environment. Asbestos fibers are so small you can't see them. If you disturb asbestos; the fibers can float in the air. This makes them easy to inhale; and some may become lodged in the lungs.If you breathe in high levels of asbestos over a long period of time; the fibers can build up in the lungs.  This causes scarring and inflammation; and can affect breathing. Eventually it can lead to diseases such asAsbestosis; or scarring of the lungs that makes it hard to breatheMesothelioma; a rare cancer that affects the lining of the lungs or abdomenLung cancerLung diseases associated with asbestos usually develop over many years. People who become ill from asbestos are usually exposed on the job over long periods of time. Smoking cigarettes increases the risk.Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry

Vitamin C,https://medlineplus.gov/vitaminc.html,Vitamins are substances that your body needs to grow and develop normally. Vitamin C is an antioxidant. It is important for your skin; bones; and connective tissue.  It promotes healing and helps the body absorb iron.Vitamin C comes from fruits and vegetables.  Good sources include citrus; red and green peppers; tomatoes; broccoli; and greens. Some juices and cereals have added vitamin C.Some people may need extra vitamin C:Pregnant/breastfeeding womenSmokersPeople recovering from surgeryBurn victims
Meningitis,https://medlineplus.gov/meningitis.html,Meningitis is inflammation of the thin tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord; called the meninges. There are several types of meningitis. The most common is viral meningitis. You get it when a virus enters the body through the nose or mouth and travels to the brain. Bacterial meningitis is rare; but can be deadly. It usually starts with bacteria that cause a cold-like infection. It can cause stroke; hearing loss; and brain damage. It can also harm other organs. Pneumococcal infections and meningococcal infections are the most common causes of bacterial meningitis.Anyone can get meningitis; but it is more common in people with weak immune systems. Meningitis can get serious very quickly. You should get medical care right away if you haveA sudden high fever A severe headache A stiff neck Nausea or vomitingEarly treatment can help prevent serious problems; including death. Tests to diagnose meningitis include blood tests; imaging tests; and a spinal tap to test cerebrospinal fluid. Antibiotics can treat bacterial meningitis. Antiviral medicines may help some types of viral meningitis. Other medicines can help treat symptoms.There are vaccines to prevent some of the bacterial infections that cause meningitis.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Osteonecrosis,https://medlineplus.gov/osteonecrosis.html,Osteonecrosis is a disease caused by reduced blood flow to bones in the joints. In people with healthy bones; new bone is always replacing old bone. In osteonecrosis; the lack of blood causes the bone to break down faster than the body can make enough new bone. The bone starts to die and may break down.You can have osteonecrosis in one or several bones. It is most common in the upper leg. Other common sites are your upper arm and your knees; shoulders and ankles. The disease can affect men and women of any age; but it usually strikes in your thirties; forties or fifties. At first; you might not have any symptoms. As the disease gets worse; you will probably have joint pain that becomes more severe. You may not be able to bend or move the affected joint very well. No one is sure what causes the disease. Risk factors include Long-term steroid treatmentAlcohol abuseJoint injuriesHaving certain diseases; including arthritis and cancer  Doctors use imaging tests and other tests to diagnose osteonecrosis. Treatments include medicines; using crutches; limiting activities that put weight on the affected joints; electrical stimulation and surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases

Autism Spectrum Disorder,https://medlineplus.gov/autismspectrumdisorder.html,Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that begins early in childhood and lasts throughout a person's life. It affects how a person acts and interacts with others; communicates; and learns.  It includes what used to be known as Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorders.It is called a "spectrum" disorder because people with ASD can have a range of symptoms. People with ASD might have problems talking with you; or they might not look you in the eye when you talk to them.  They may also have restricted interests and repetitive behaviors.  They may spend a lot of time putting things in order; or they may say the same sentence again and again. They may often seem to be in their "own world."At well-child checkups; the health care provider should check your child's development.  If there are signs of ASD; your child will have a comprehensive evaluation.  It may include a team of specialists; doing various tests and evaluations to make a diagnosis.The causes of ASD are not known.  Research suggests that both genes and environment play important roles.There is currently no one standard treatment for ASD.  There are many ways to increase your child's ability to grow and learn new skills.  Starting them early can lead to better results.  Treatments include behavior and communication therapies; skills training; and medicines to control symptoms.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Aspergillosis,https://medlineplus.gov/aspergillosis.html,Aspergillosis is a disease caused by a fungus (or mold) called Aspergillus.  The fungus is very common in both indoors and outdoors. Most people breathe in the spores of the fungus every day without being affected. But some people get the disease. It usually occurs in people with lung diseases or weakened immune systems.There are different kinds of aspergillosis. One kind is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (also called ABPA).  Symptoms of ABPA include wheezing and coughing. ABPA can affect healthy people but it is most common in people with asthma or cystic fibrosis.Another kind is invasive aspergillosis; which damages tissues in the body. It usually affects the lungs. Sometimes it can also cause infection in other organs and spread throughout the body. It affects people who have immune system problems; such as people who have had a transplant; are taking high doses of steroids; or getting chemotherapy for some cancers.Your doctor might do a variety of tests to make the diagnosis; including a chest x-ray; CT scan of the lungs; and  an examination of tissues for signs of the fungus. Treatment is with antifungal drugs. If you have ABPA; you may also take steroids.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Critical Care,https://medlineplus.gov/criticalcare.html,Critical care helps people with life-threatening injuries and illnesses. It might treat problems such as complications from surgery; accidents; infections; and severe breathing problems.  It involves close; constant attention by a team of specially-trained health care  providers.  Critical care usually takes place in an intensive care unit (ICU) or trauma center.Monitors; intravenous (IV) tubes; feeding tubes; catheters; breathing machines; and other equipment are common in critical care units.  They can keep a person alive; but can also increase the risk of infection.Many patients in critical care recover; but some die. Having advance directives in place is important. They help health care providers and family members make end-of-life decisions if you are not able to make them.
Assisted Living,https://medlineplus.gov/assistedliving.html,Assisted living is for adults who need help with everyday tasks. They may need help with dressing; bathing; eating; or using the bathroom; but they don't need full-time nursing care. Some assisted living facilities are part of retirement communities. Others are near nursing homes; so a person can move easily if needs change.Assisted living costs less than nursing home care. It is still fairly expensive. Older people or their families usually pay for it. Health and long-term care insurance policies may cover some of the costs. Medicare does not cover the costs of assisted living. Administration on Aging
Assisted Reproductive Technology,https://medlineplus.gov/assistedreproductivetechnology.html,Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is used to treat infertility. It includes fertility treatments that handle both a woman's egg and a man's sperm. It works by removing eggs from a woman's body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman's body. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most common and effective type of ART. ART procedures sometimes use donor eggs; donor sperm; or previously frozen embryos. It may also involve a surrogate or gestational carrier. A surrogate is a woman who becomes pregnant with sperm from the male partner of the couple. A gestational carrier becomes pregnant with an egg from the female partner and the sperm from the male partner. The most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. It can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are put into the woman's body.
Assistive Devices,https://medlineplus.gov/assistivedevices.html,If you have a disability or injury; you may use a number of assistive devices. These are tools; products or types of equipment that help you perform tasks and activities. They may help you move around; see; communicate; eat; or get dressed. Some are high-tech tools; such as computers. Others are much simpler; like a "reacher" - a tool that helps you grab an object you can't reach.
Asthma,https://medlineplus.gov/asthma.html,Asthma is a chronic disease that affects your airways. Your airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma; the inside walls of your airways become sore and swollen. That makes them very sensitive; and they may react strongly to things that you are allergic to or find irritating. When your airways react; they get narrower and your lungs get less air.Symptoms of asthma includeWheezingCoughing; especially early in the morning or at nightChest tightnessShortness of breathNot all people who have asthma have these symptoms. Having these symptoms doesn't always mean that you have asthma. Your doctor will diagnose asthma based on lung function tests; your medical history; and a physical exam. You may also have allergy tests.When your asthma symptoms become worse than usual; it's called an asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care; and they can be fatal.Asthma is treated with two kinds of medicines: quick-relief medicines to stop asthma symptoms and long-term control medicines to prevent symptoms. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Asthma in Children,https://medlineplus.gov/asthmainchildren.html,Asthma is a chronic disease that affects your airways. Your airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma; the inside walls of your airways become sore and swollen.In the United States; about 20 million people have asthma.  Nearly 9 million of them are children. Children have smaller airways than adults; which makes asthma especially serious for them. Children with asthma may experience wheezing; coughing; chest tightness; and trouble breathing; especially early in the morning or at night. Many things can cause asthma; including Allergens - mold; pollen; animalsIrritants - cigarette smoke; air pollutionWeather - cold air; changes in weatherExercise Infections - flu; common coldWhen asthma symptoms become worse than usual; it is called an asthma attack. Asthma is treated with two kinds of medicines: quick-relief medicines to stop asthma symptoms and long-term control medicines to prevent symptoms.
Refractive Errors,https://medlineplus.gov/refractiveerrors.html,The cornea and lens of your eye helps you focus.  Refractive errors are vision problems that happen when the shape of the eye keeps you from focusing well. The cause could be the length of the eyeball (longer or shorter); changes in the shape of the cornea; or aging of the lens.Four common refractive errors areMyopia; or nearsightedness - clear vision close up but  blurry in the distanceHyperopia; or farsightedness - clear vision in the distance but blurry close upPresbyopia - inability to focus close up as a result of agingAstigmatism - focus problems caused by the corneaThe most common symptom is blurred vision. Other symptoms may include double vision; haziness; glare or halos around bright lights; squinting; headaches; or eye strain.Glasses or contact lenses can usually correct refractive errors. Laser eye surgery may also be a possibility.NIH: National Eye Institute
Cerebellar Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/cerebellardisorders.html,When you play the piano or hit a tennis ball you are activating the cerebellum. The cerebellum is the area of the brain that controls coordination and balance. Problems with the cerebellum includeCancerGenetic disordersAtaxias - failure of muscle control in the arms and legs that result in movement disordersDegeneration - disorders caused by brain cells decreasing in size or wasting awayTreatment of cerebellar disorders depends on the cause. In some cases; there is no cure but treatment may help with symptoms.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Degenerative Nerve Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/degenerativenervediseases.html,Degenerative nerve diseases affect many of your body's activities; such as balance; movement; talking; breathing; and heart function.   Many of these diseases are genetic. Sometimes the cause is a medical condition such as alcoholism; a tumor; or a stroke. Other causes may include toxins; chemicals; and viruses.  Sometimes the cause is not known.Degenerative nerve diseases include Alzheimer's disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosisFriedreich's ataxia Huntington's disease Lewy body diseaseParkinson's disease  Spinal muscular atrophyDegenerative nerve diseases can be serious or life-threatening. It depends on the type. Most of them have no cure. Treatments may help improve symptoms; relieve pain; and increase mobility.
Friedreich's Ataxia,https://medlineplus.gov/friedreichsataxia.html,Friedreich's ataxia is an inherited disease that damages your nervous system. The damage affects your spinal cord and the nerves that control muscle movement in your arms and legs.  Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5 and 15. The main symptom is ataxia; which means trouble coordinating movements. Specific symptoms includeDifficulty walkingMuscle weaknessSpeech problemsInvoluntary eye movementsScoliosis (curving of the spine to one side)Heart palpitations; from the heart disease which can happen along with Friedreich's ataxiaPeople with Friedreich's ataxia usually need a wheelchair 15 to 20 years after symptoms first appear. In severe cases; people become incapacitated. There is no cure. You can treat symptoms with medicines; braces; surgery; and physical therapy.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Movement Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/movementdisorders.html,Imagine if parts of your body moved when you didn't want them to. If you have a movement disorder; you experience these kinds of impaired movement. Dyskinesia is abnormal uncontrolled movement and is a common symptom of many movement disorders. Tremors are a type of dyskinesia. Nerve diseases cause many movement disorders; such as Parkinson's disease. Other causes include injuries; autoimmune diseases; infections and certain medicines. Many movement disorders are inherited; which means they run in families.Treatment varies by disorder. Medicine can cure some disorders. Others get better when an underlying disease is treated. Often; however; there is no cure. In that case; the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms and relieve pain.
Ataxia Telangiectasia,https://medlineplus.gov/ataxiatelangiectasia.html,Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare; inherited disease. It affects the nervous system; immune system; and other body systems.  Symptoms appear in young children; usually before age 5. They includeAtaxia - trouble coordinating movementsPoor balance Slurred speechTiny; red spider veins; called telangiectasias; on the skin and eyesLung infectionsDelayed physical and sexual developmentPeople with A-T have an increased risk of developing diabetes and cancers; especially lymphoma and leukemia. Although it affects the brain; people with A-T usually have normal or high intelligence.A-T has no cure. Treatments might improve some symptoms. They include injections to strengthen the immune system; physical and speech therapy; and high-dose vitamins. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Collapsed Lung,https://medlineplus.gov/collapsedlung.html,A collapsed lung happens when air enters the pleural space; the area between the lung and the chest wall. If it is a total collapse; it is called pneumothorax. If only part of the lung is affected; it is called atelectasis.Causes of a collapsed lung includeLung diseases such as pneumonia or lung cancerBeing on a breathing machineSurgery on the chest or abdomenA blocked airwayIf only a small area of the lung is affected; you may not have symptoms. If a large area is affected; you may feel short of breath and have a rapid heart rate.A chest x-ray can tell if you have it. Treatment depends on the underlying cause.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Atherosclerosis,https://medlineplus.gov/atherosclerosis.html,Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Plaque is a sticky substance made up of fat; cholesterol; calcium; and other substances found in the blood. Over time; plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. That limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body.Atherosclerosis can lead to serious problems; includingCoronary artery disease. These arteries supply blood to your heart. When they are blocked; you can suffer angina or a heart attack.Carotid artery disease. These arteries supply blood to your brain. When they are blocked you can suffer a stroke.Peripheral arterial disease. These arteries are in your arms; legs and pelvis. When they are blocked; you can suffer from numbness; pain and sometimes infections.Atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause symptoms until it severely narrows or totally blocks an artery. Many people don't know they have it until they have a medical emergency.A physical exam; imaging; and other diagnostic tests can tell if you have it. Medicines can slow the progress of plaque buildup. Your doctor may also recommend procedures such as angioplasty to open the arteries; or surgery on the coronary or carotid arteries. Lifestyle changes can also help. These include following a healthy diet; getting regular exercise; maintaining a healthy weight; quitting smoking; and managing stress. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Coronary Artery Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/coronaryarterydisease.html,Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease. It is the leading cause of death in the United States in both men and women.CAD happens when the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material; called plaque; on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows; less blood can flow through the arteries. As a result; the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack.  Most heart attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the hearts' blood supply; causing permanent heart damage.  Over time; CAD can also weaken the heart muscle and contribute to heart failure and arrhythmias. Heart failure means the heart can't pump blood well to the rest of the body. Arrhythmias are changes in the normal beating rhythm of the heart.  NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Athlete's Foot,https://medlineplus.gov/athletesfoot.html,Athlete's foot is a common infection caused by a fungus.  It most often affects the space between the toes. Symptoms include itching; burning; and cracked; scaly skin between your toes.You can get athlete's foot from damp surfaces; such as showers; swimming pools; and locker room floors. To prevent itKeep your feet clean; dry; and coolWear clean socksDon't walk barefoot in public areasWear flip-flops in locker room showersKeep your toenails clean and clipped shortTreatments include over-the-counter antifungal creams for most cases and prescription medicines for more serious infections. These usually clear up the infection; but it can come back.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Eczema,https://medlineplus.gov/eczema.html,Eczema is a term for several different types of skin swelling. Eczema is also called dermatitis. Most types cause dry; itchy skin and rashes on the face; inside the elbows and behind the knees; and on the hands and feet. Scratching the skin can cause it to turn red; and to swell and itch even more.Eczema is not contagious. The cause is not known. It is likely caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Eczema may get better or worse over time; but it is often a long-lasting disease. People who have it may also develop hay fever and asthma.The most common type of eczema is atopic dermatitis. It is most common in babies and children but adults can have it too. As children who have atopic dermatitis grow older; this problem may get better or go away. But sometimes the skin may stay dry and get irritated easily.Treatments may include medicines; skin creams; light therapy; and good skin care. You can prevent some types of eczema by avoidingThings that irritate your skin; such as certain soaps; fabrics; and lotionsStressThings you are allergic to; such as food; pollen; and animalsNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Atrial Fibrillation,https://medlineplus.gov/atrialfibrillation.html,An arrhythmia is a problem with the speed or rhythm of the heartbeat.  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of arrhythmia. The cause is a disorder in the heart's electrical system.Often; people who have AF may not even feel symptoms. But you may feelPalpitations -- an abnormal rapid heartbeatShortness of breathWeakness or difficulty exercisingChest painDizziness or faintingFatigueConfusionAF can lead to an increased risk of stroke. In many patients; it can also cause chest pain; heart attack; or heart failure. Doctors diagnose AF using family and medical history; a physical exam; and a test called an electrocardiogram (EKG); which looks at the electrical waves your heart makes. Treatments include medicines and procedures to restore normal rhythm.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,https://medlineplus.gov/attentiondeficithyperactivitydisorder.html,Is it hard for your child to sit still? Does your child act without thinking first? Does your child start but not finish things? If so; your child may have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Nearly everyone shows some of these behaviors at times; but ADHD lasts more than 6 months and causes problems in school; at home and in social situations.ADHD is more common in boys than girls. It affects 3-5 percent of all American children.The main features of ADHD areInattentionHyperactivityImpulsivityNo one knows exactly what causes ADHD. It sometimes runs in families; so genetics may be a factor. There may also be environmental factors.A complete evaluation by a trained professional is the only way to know for sure if your child has ADHD.  Treatment may include medicine to control symptoms; therapy; or both. Structure at home and at school is important. Parent training may also help.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
Acoustic Neuroma,https://medlineplus.gov/acousticneuroma.html,An acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor that develops on the nerve that connects the ear to the brain. The tumor usually grows slowly. As it grows; it presses against the hearing and balance nerves. At first; you may have no symptoms or mild symptoms. They can include Loss of hearing on one side  Ringing in ears Dizziness and balance problemsThe tumor can also eventually cause numbness or paralysis of the face. If it grows large enough; it can press against the brain; becoming life-threatening.Acoustic neuroma can be difficult to diagnose; because the symptoms are similar to those of middle ear problems.  Ear exams; hearing tests; and scans can show if you have it.If the tumor stays small; you may only need to have it checked regularly.  If you do need treatment; surgery and radiation are options.If the tumors affect both hearing nerves; it is often because of a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders
Autism Spectrum Disorder,https://medlineplus.gov/autismspectrumdisorder.html,Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that begins early in childhood and lasts throughout a person's life. It affects how a person acts and interacts with others; communicates; and learns.  It includes what used to be known as Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorders.It is called a "spectrum" disorder because people with ASD can have a range of symptoms. People with ASD might have problems talking with you; or they might not look you in the eye when you talk to them.  They may also have restricted interests and repetitive behaviors.  They may spend a lot of time putting things in order; or they may say the same sentence again and again. They may often seem to be in their "own world."At well-child checkups; the health care provider should check your child's development.  If there are signs of ASD; your child will have a comprehensive evaluation.  It may include a team of specialists; doing various tests and evaluations to make a diagnosis.The causes of ASD are not known.  Research suggests that both genes and environment play important roles.There is currently no one standard treatment for ASD.  There are many ways to increase your child's ability to grow and learn new skills.  Starting them early can lead to better results.  Treatments include behavior and communication therapies; skills training; and medicines to control symptoms.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development

Autoimmune Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html,Your body's immune system protects you from disease and infection. But if you have an autoimmune disease; your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Autoimmune diseases can affect many parts of the body.No one is sure what causes autoimmune diseases. They do tend to run in families. Women - particularly African-American; Hispanic-American; and Native-American women - have a higher risk for some autoimmune diseases.There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases; and some have similar symptoms. This makes it hard for your health care provider to know if you really have one of these diseases; and if so; which one. Getting a diagnosis can be frustrating and stressful. Often; the first symptoms are fatigue; muscle aches and a low fever. The classic sign of an autoimmune disease is inflammation; which can cause redness; heat; pain and swelling.The diseases may also have flare-ups; when they get worse; and remissions; when symptoms get better or disappear. Treatment depends on the disease; but in most cases one important goal is to reduce inflammation. Sometimes doctors prescribe corticosteroids or other drugs that reduce your immune response.

Cardiac Arrest,https://medlineplus.gov/cardiacarrest.html,The heart has an internal electrical system that controls the rhythm of the heartbeat. Problems can cause abnormal heart rhythms; called arrhythmias. There are many types of arrhythmia. During an arrhythmia; the heart can beat too fast; too slow; or it can stop beating. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurs when the heart develops an arrhythmia that causes it to stop beating. This is different than a heart attack; where the heart usually continues to beat but blood flow to the heart is blocked. There are many possible causes of SCA. They include coronary heart disease; physical stress; and some inherited disorders. Sometimes there is no known cause for the SCA.Without medical attention; the person will die within a few minutes. People are less likely to die if they have early defibrillation. Defibrillation sends an electric shock to restore the heart rhythm to normal. You should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to a person having SCA until defibrillation can be done.If you have had an SCA; an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) reduces the chance of dying from a second SCA.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Motor Vehicle Safety,https://medlineplus.gov/motorvehiclesafety.html,Every year thousands of people in the U.S. die from motor vehicle crashes. Trying to prevent these crashes is one part of motor vehicle safety.  Here are some things you can do to be safer on the road: Make sure your vehicle is safe and in working order Use car seats for children Wear your seat belt Don't speed or drive aggressively Don't drive impairedSafety also involves being aware of others. Share the road with bicycles and motorcycles; and watch for pedestrians.
Autonomic Nervous System Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/autonomicnervoussystemdisorders.html,Your autonomic nervous system is the part of your nervous system that controls involuntary actions; such as the beating of your heart and the widening or narrowing of your blood vessels. When something goes wrong in this system; it can cause serious problems; including  Blood pressure problems Heart problems Trouble with breathing and swallowing Erectile dysfunction in men  Autonomic nervous system disorders can occur alone or as the result of another disease; such as Parkinson's disease; alcoholism and diabetes. Problems can affect either part of the system; as in complex regional pain syndromes; or all of the system. Some types are temporary; but many worsen over time. When they affect your breathing or heart function; these disorders can be life-threatening. Some autonomic nervous system disorders get better when an underlying disease is treated. Often; however; there is no cure. In that case; the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms.  NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Osteonecrosis,https://medlineplus.gov/osteonecrosis.html,Osteonecrosis is a disease caused by reduced blood flow to bones in the joints. In people with healthy bones; new bone is always replacing old bone. In osteonecrosis; the lack of blood causes the bone to break down faster than the body can make enough new bone. The bone starts to die and may break down.You can have osteonecrosis in one or several bones. It is most common in the upper leg. Other common sites are your upper arm and your knees; shoulders and ankles. The disease can affect men and women of any age; but it usually strikes in your thirties; forties or fifties. At first; you might not have any symptoms. As the disease gets worse; you will probably have joint pain that becomes more severe. You may not be able to bend or move the affected joint very well. No one is sure what causes the disease. Risk factors include Long-term steroid treatmentAlcohol abuseJoint injuriesHaving certain diseases; including arthritis and cancer  Doctors use imaging tests and other tests to diagnose osteonecrosis. Treatments include medicines; using crutches; limiting activities that put weight on the affected joints; electrical stimulation and surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Bird Flu,https://medlineplus.gov/birdflu.html,Birds; just like people; get the flu. Bird flu viruses infect birds; including chickens; other poultry; and wild birds such as ducks. Usually bird flu viruses only infect other birds. It is rare for people to get infected with bird flu viruses; but it can happen. Two types; H5N1 and H7N9; have infected some people during outbreaks in Asia; Africa; the Pacific; the Middle East; and parts of Europe. There have also been some rare cases of other types of bird flu affecting people in the United States.Most of the people who get bird flu have had close contact with infected birds or with surfaces that have been contaminated by the birds' saliva; mucous; or droppings. It is also possible to get it by breathing in droplets or dust that contain the virus. Rarely; the virus has spread from one person to another. It may also be possible to catch bird flu by eating poultry or eggs that are not well cooked.Bird flu illness in people can range from mild to severe. Often; the symptoms are similar to the seasonal flu; such asFeverCoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesFatigueHeadachesEye redness (or conjunctivitis)Difficulty breathingIn some cases; bird flu can cause serious complications and death. As with seasonal flu; some people are at higher risk for serious illness. They include pregnant women; people with weakened immune systems; and seniors aged 65 and older. Treatment with antiviral medicines may make the illness less severe. They may also help prevent the flu in people who were exposed to it. There is currently no vaccine available to the public. The government does have a supply of a vaccine for one type of H5N1 bird flu virus and could distribute it if there was an outbreak that spread easily from person to person.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Arteriovenous Malformations,https://medlineplus.gov/arteriovenousmalformations.html,Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are defects in your vascular system. The vascular system includes arteries; veins; and capillaries. Arteries carry blood away from the heart to other organs; veins carry blood back to the heart. Capillaries connect the arteries and veins.  An AVM is a snarled tangle of arteries and veins. They are connected to each other; with no capillaries. That interferes with the blood circulation in an organ.AVMs can happen anywhere; but they are more common in the brain or spinal cord. Most people with brain or spinal cord AVMs have few; if any; major symptoms. Sometimes they can cause seizures or headaches.AVMs are rare. The cause is not known; but they seem to develop during pregnancy or soon after birth. Doctors use imaging tests to detect them.Medicines can help with the symptoms from AVMs. The greatest danger is hemorrhage. Treatment for AVMs can include surgery or focused radiation therapy. Because surgery can be risky; you and your doctor need to make a decision carefully.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
B Vitamins,https://medlineplus.gov/bvitamins.html,The B vitamins are  B1 (thiamine) B2 (riboflavin) B3 (niacin) B5 (pantothenic acid) B6 B7 (biotin) B12 Folic acid  These vitamins help the process your body uses to get or make energy from the food you eat. They also help form red blood cells.  You can get B vitamins from proteins such as fish; poultry; meat; eggs; and dairy products.  Leafy green vegetables; beans; and peas also have B vitamins.  Many cereals and some breads have added B vitamins. Not getting enough of certain B vitamins can cause diseases.  A lack of B12 or B6 can cause anemia.
Tick Bites,https://medlineplus.gov/tickbites.html,If you spend time outdoors or have pets that go outdoors; you need to beware of ticks. Ticks are small bloodsucking parasites. Many species transmit diseases to animals and people. Some of the diseases you can get from a tick bite are Lyme disease; ehrlichiosis; Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.  Some ticks are so small that they can be difficult to see. Ticks may get on you if you walk through areas where they live; such as tall grass; leaf litter or shrubs.  Tick-borne diseases occur worldwide; including in your own backyard. To help protect yourself and your family; you should   Use a chemical repellent with DEET; permethrin or picaridin  Wear light-colored protective clothing   Tuck pant legs into socks   Avoid tick-infested areas   Check yourself; your children and your pets daily for ticks and carefully remove any ticks you find
Postpartum Depression,https://medlineplus.gov/postpartumdepression.html,Many women have the baby blues after childbirth. If you have the baby blues; you may have mood swings; feel sad; anxious or overwhelmed; have crying spells; lose your appetite; or have trouble sleeping. The baby blues most often go away within a few days or a week. The symptoms are not severe and do not need treatment.The symptoms of postpartum depression last longer and are more severe.   You may also feel hopeless and worthless; and lose interest in the baby. You may have thoughts of hurting yourself or the baby. Very rarely; new mothers develop something even more serious. They may have hallucinations or try to hurt themselves or the baby. They need to get treatment right away; often in the hospital.Postpartum depression can begin anytime within the first year after childbirth. The cause is not known.  Hormonal and physical changes after birth and the stress of caring for a new baby may play a role. Women who have had depression are at higher risk.If you think you have postpartum depression; tell your health care provider. Medicines; including antidepressants and talk therapy can help you get well.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Infant and Newborn Care,https://medlineplus.gov/infantandnewborncare.html,Going home with a new baby is exciting; but it can be scary; too. Newborns have many needs; like frequent feedings and diaper changes. Babies can have health issues that are different from older children and adults; like diaper rash and cradle cap.  Your baby will go through many changes during the first year of life. You may feel uneasy at first. Ask your health care provider for help if you need it.
Baby Health Checkup,https://medlineplus.gov/babyhealthcheckup.html,There are many new responsibilities when you have a baby.  One of them is to make sure they get the checkups that they need.  Well-baby exams are important in making sure that your baby is growing and developing properly.  If there are problems; you can catch them early.

This is also a good chance to ask your health care provider any questions about how to care for your baby.
Back Injuries,https://medlineplus.gov/backinjuries.html,Your back is made of bones; muscles; and other tissues extending from your neck to your pelvis. Back injuries can result from sports injuries; work around the house or in the garden; or a sudden jolt such as a car accident. The lower back is the most common site of back injuries and back pain. Common back injuries include Sprains and strains  Herniated disksFractured vertebraeThese injuries can cause pain and limit your movement. Treatments vary but might include medicines; icing; bed rest; physical therapy; or surgery. You might be able to prevent some back injuries by maintaining a healthy weight; lifting objects with your legs; and using lower-back support when you sit.
Back Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/backpain.html,If you've ever groaned; "Oh; my aching back!"; you are not alone. Back pain is one of the most common medical problems; affecting 8 out of 10 people at some point during their lives. Back pain can range from a dull; constant ache to a sudden; sharp pain. Acute back pain comes on suddenly and usually lasts from a few days to a few weeks. Back pain is called chronic if it lasts for more than three months.Most back pain goes away on its own; though it may take awhile. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers and resting can help. However; staying in bed for more than 1 or 2 days can make it worse. If your back pain is severe or doesn't improve after three days; you should call your health care provider.  You should also get medical attention if you have back pain following an injury.Treatment for back pain depends on what kind of pain you have; and what is causing it. It may include hot or cold packs; exercise; medicines; injections; complementary treatments; and sometimes surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Sepsis,https://medlineplus.gov/sepsis.html,Sepsis is a serious illness. It happens when your body has an overwhelming immune response to a bacterial infection.  The chemicals released into the blood to fight the infection trigger widespread inflammation. This leads to blood clots and leaky blood vessels. They cause poor blood flow; which deprives your body's organs of nutrients and oxygen. In severe cases; one or more organs fail. In the worst cases; blood pressure drops and the heart weakens; leading to septic shock.Anyone can get sepsis; but the risk is higher inPeople with weakened immune systemsInfants and childrenThe elderlyPeople with chronic illnesses; such as diabetes; AIDS; cancer; and kidney or liver diseasePeople suffering from a severe burn or physical traumaCommon symptoms of sepsis are fever; chills; rapid breathing and heart rate; rash; confusion; and disorientation. Doctors diagnose sepsis using a blood test to see if the number of white blood cells is abnormal. They also do lab tests that check for signs of infection.People with sepsis are usually treated in hospital intensive care units. Doctors try to treat the infection; sustain the vital organs; and prevent a drop in blood pressure. Many patients receive oxygen and intravenous (IV) fluids. Other types of treatment; such as respirators or kidney dialysis; may be necessary. Sometimes; surgery is needed to clear up an infection.NIH: National Institute of General Medical Sciences
Bacterial Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/bacterialinfections.html,Bacteria are living things that have only one cell.  Under a microscope; they look like balls; rods; or spirals. They are so small that a line of 1;000 could fit across a pencil eraser. Most bacteria won't hurt you - less than 1 percent of the different types make people sick. Many are helpful. Some bacteria help to digest food; destroy disease-causing cells; and give the body needed vitamins. Bacteria are also used in making healthy foods like yogurt and cheese.But infectious bacteria can make you ill. They reproduce quickly in your body. Many give off chemicals called toxins; which can damage tissue and make you sick. Examples of bacteria that cause infections include Streptococcus; Staphylococcus; and E. coli.Antibiotics are the usual treatment. When you take antibiotics; follow the directions carefully. Each time you take antibiotics; you increase the chances that bacteria in your body will learn to resist them causing antibiotic resistance. Later; you could get or spread an infection that those antibiotics cannot cure.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Vaginitis,https://medlineplus.gov/vaginitis.html,What is vaginitis?Vaginitis; also called vulvovaginitis; is an inflammation or infection of the vagina. It can also affect the vulva; which is the external part of a woman's genitals. Vaginitis can cause itching; pain; discharge; and odor.Vaginitis is common; especially in women in their reproductive years.  It usually happens when there is a change in the balance of bacteria or yeast that are normally found in your vagina. There are different types of vaginitis; and they have different causes; symptoms; and treatments.What are the different causes of vaginitis?Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44. It happens when there is an imbalance between the "good" and "harmful" bacteria that are normally found in a woman's vagina. Many things can change the balance of bacteria; includingTaking antibioticsDouchingUsing an intrauterine device (IUD)Having unprotected sex with a new partnerHaving many sexual partnersYeast infections (candidiasis) happen when too much candida grows in the vagina. Candida is the scientific name for yeast. It is a fungus that lives almost everywhere; including in your body. You may have too much growing in the vagina because ofAntibioticsPregnancyDiabetes; especially if it is not well-controlledCorticosteroid medicinesTrichomoniasis can also cause vaginitis. Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted disease. It is caused by a parasite.You can also have vaginitis if you are allergic or sensitive to certain products that you use. Examples include vaginal sprays; douches; spermicides; soaps; detergents; or fabric softeners. They can cause burning; itching; and discharge.Hormonal changes can also cause vaginal irritation. Examples are when you are pregnant or breastfeeding; or when you have gone through menopause.Sometimes you can have more than one cause of vaginitis at the same time.What are the symptoms of vaginitis?The symptoms of vaginitis depend on which type you have.With BV; you may not have symptoms. You could have a thin white or gray vaginal discharge. There may be an odor; such as a strong fish-like odor; especially after sex.Yeast infections produce a thick; white discharge from the vagina that can look like cottage cheese. The discharge can be watery and often has no smell. Yeast infections usually cause the vagina and vulva to become itchy and red.You may not have symptoms when you have trichomoniasis. If you do have them; they include itching; burning; and soreness of the vagina and vulva. You may have burning during urination. You could also have gray-green discharge; which may smell bad.How is the cause of vaginitis diagnosed?To find out the cause of your symptoms; your health care provider mayAsk you about your health historyDo a pelvic examLook for vaginal discharge; noting its color; qualities; and any odorStudy a sample of your vaginal fluid under a microscopeIn some cases; you may need more tests.What are the treatments for vaginitis?The treatment depends on which type of vaginitis you have.BV is treatable with antibiotics. You may get pills to swallow; or cream or gel that you put in your vagina. During treatment; you should use a condom during sex or not have sex at all.Yeast infections are usually treated with a cream or with medicine that you put inside your vagina. You can buy over-the-counter treatments for yeast infections; but you need to be sure that you do have a yeast infection and not another type of vaginitis. See your health care provider if this is the first time you have had symptoms. Even if you have had yeast infections before; it is a good idea to call your health care provider before using an over-the-counter treatment.The treatment for trichomoniasis is usually a single-dose antibiotic. Both you and your partner(s) should be treated; to prevent spreading the infection to others and to keep from getting it again.If your vaginitis is due to an allergy or sensitivity to a product; you need to figure out which product is causing the problem. It could be a product that you started using recently. Once you figure it out; you should stop using the product.If the cause of your vaginitis is a hormonal change; your health care provider may give you estrogen cream to help with your symptoms.Can vaginitis cause other health problems?It is important to treat BV and trichomoniasis; because having either of them can increase your risk for getting HIV or another sexually transmitted disease. If you are pregnant; BV or trichomoniasis can increase your risk for preterm labor and preterm birth.How can I prevent vaginitis?To help prevent vaginitisDo not douche or use vaginal spraysUse a condom when having sexAvoid clothes that hold in heat and moistureWear cotton underwear
Bad Breath,https://medlineplus.gov/badbreath.html,There are many reasons why you might have bad breath.  You can get it if you don't brush and floss regularly. Bacteria that build up in your mouth and between your teeth produce the bad odor. Other problems in your mouth; such as gum disease; dry mouth; or cavities; may also cause it. Sinusitis or problems with your nose may be to blame. You can also have bad breath if you eat some foods; like raw onions; garlic; or cabbage. And of course smoking causes its own bad smell. Some diseases and medicines can cause a specific breath odor.Having good dental habits; like brushing and flossing regularly; help fight bad breath. Mouthwashes; mints or chewing gum may make your breath fresher. If you have a disease that causes the bad breath; treating the disease may help give you fresher breath.
Knee Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/kneeinjuriesanddisorders.html,Your knee joint is made up of bone; cartilage; ligaments and fluid. Muscles and tendons help the knee joint move. When any of these structures is hurt or diseased; you have knee problems. Knee problems can cause pain and difficulty walking.Knee problems are very common; and they occur in people of all ages. Knee problems can interfere with many things; from participation in sports to simply getting up from a chair and walking. This can have a big impact on your life.The most common disease affecting the knee is osteoarthritis. The cartilage in the knee gradually wears away; causing pain and swelling.Injuries to ligaments and tendons also cause knee problems. A common injury is to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). You usually injure your ACL by a sudden twisting motion. ACL and other knee injuries are common sports injuries.Treatment of knee problems depends on the cause. In some cases your doctor may recommend knee replacement.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Balance Problems,https://medlineplus.gov/balanceproblems.html,Have you ever felt dizzy; lightheaded; or as if the room is spinning around you? If the feeling happens often; it could be a sign of a balance problem. Balance problems can make you feel unsteady. You may also have blurred vision; confusion; and disorientation. They are one cause of falls and fall-related injuries; such as a hip fracture.Some balance problems are due to problems in the inner ear. Others may involve another part of the body; such as the brain or the heart. Aging; infections; head injury; certain medicines; or problems with blood circulation may also cause balance problems.It is important to see your doctor about balance problems. They can be a sign of other health problems; such as an ear infection or a stroke. Your doctor may send you to a specialist for a diagnosis. You may need a hearing test; blood tests; or imaging studies of your head and brain. Other possible tests look at your eye movements; and how your body responds to movement.In some cases; treating the illness that is causing the disorder will help with the balance problem. Exercises; a change in diet; and some medicines also can help.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Penis Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/penisdisorders.html,Problems with the penis can cause pain and affect a man's sexual function and fertility. Penis disorders include   Erectile dysfunction - inability to get or keep an erection  Priapism - a painful erection that does not go away  Peyronie's disease - bending of the penis during an erection due to a hard lump called a plaque  Balanitis - inflammation of the skin covering the head of the penis; most often in men and boys who have not been circumcised  Penile cancer - a rare form of cancer; highly curable when caught early
Weight Loss Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/weightlosssurgery.html,Weight loss surgery helps people with extreme obesity to lose weight. It may be an option if you cannot lose weight through diet and exercise or have serious health problems caused by obesity.There are different types of weight loss surgery.  They often limit the amount of food you can take in. Some types of surgery also affect how you digest food and absorb nutrients. All types have risks and complications; such as infections; hernias; and blood clots.Many people who have the surgery lose weight quickly; but regain some weight later on.  If you follow diet and exercise recommendations; you can keep most of the weight off. You will also need medical follow-up for the rest of your life.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Barotrauma,https://medlineplus.gov/barotrauma.html,Barotrauma means injury to your body because of changes in barometric (air) or water pressure.  One common type happens to your ear. A change in altitude may cause your ears to hurt. This can happen if you are flying in an airplane; driving in the mountains; or scuba diving.  Divers can also get decompression sickness; which affects the whole body.Common symptoms of ear barotrauma includePainA feeling that your ears are stuffedHearing lossDizzinessTreatments for ear barotrauma include chewing gum and yawning to relieve the pressure. Medications such as decongestants may also help.
Esophagus Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/esophagusdisorders.html,The esophagus is the muscular tube that carries food; and liquids from your mouth to the stomach. You may not be aware of your esophagus until you swallow something too large; too hot; or too cold. You may also notice it when something is wrong. You may feel pain or have trouble swallowing.The most common problem with the esophagus is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). With GERD; a muscle at the end of your esophagus does not close properly. This allows stomach contents to leak back; or reflux; into the esophagus and irritate it. Over time; GERD can cause damage to the esophagus.Other problems include heartburn; cancer; and esophagitis. Doctors may use various tests to make a diagnosis. These include imaging tests; an upper endoscopy; and a biopsy.Treatment depends on the problem. Some problems get better with over-the-counter medicines or changes in diet. Others may need prescription medicines or surgery.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Skin Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/skincancer.html,Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States. The two most common types are basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer. They usually form on the head; face; neck; hands; and arms. Another type of skin cancer; melanoma; is more dangerous but less common. Anyone can get skin cancer; but it is more common in people who Spend a lot of time in the sun or have been sunburnedHave light-colored skin; hair and eyesHave a family member with skin cancerAre over age 50You should have your doctor check any suspicious skin markings and any changes in the way your skin looks. Treatment is more likely to work well when cancer is found early.  If not treated; some types of skin cancer cells can spread to other tissues and organs. Treatments include surgery; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; photodynamic therapy (PDT); and biologic therapy. PDT uses a drug and a type of laser light to kill cancer cells.

Hyperthyroidism,https://medlineplus.gov/hyperthyroidism.html,Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck; just above your collarbone. It is one of your endocrine glands; which make hormones. Thyroid hormones control the rate of many activities in your body. These include how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats. All of these activities are your body's metabolism. If your thyroid is too active; it makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs. This is called hyperthyroidism.Hyperthyroidism is more common in women; people with other thyroid problems; and those over 60 years old. Graves' disease; an autoimmune disorder; is the most common cause.  Other causes include thyroid nodules; thyroiditis; consuming too much iodine; and taking too much synthetic thyroid hormone.The symptoms can vary from person to person.  They may includeBeing nervous or irritableMood swingsFatigue or muscle weaknessHeat intoleranceTrouble sleepingHand tremorsRapid and irregular heartbeatFrequent bowel movements or diarrheaWeight lossGoiter; which is an enlarged thyroid that may cause the neck to look swollenTo diagnose hyperthyroidism; your doctor will do a physical exam; look at your symptoms; and do thyroid tests. Treatment is with medicines; radioiodine therapy; or thyroid surgery. No single treatment works for everyone.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Bed Bugs,https://medlineplus.gov/bedbugs.html,Bed bugs bite you and feed on your blood. You may have no reaction to the bites; or you may have small marks or itching.  Severe allergic reactions are rare. Bed bugs don't transmit or spread diseases.Adult bed bugs are brown; 1/4 to 3/8 inch long; and have a flat; oval-shaped body.

When staying in hotels; put your suitcases on luggage racks instead of the floor. Check the mattress and headboard for signs of bed bugs.To get rid of bed bugs:Wash and dry bedding and clothing at high temperaturesUse mattress; box spring; and pillow encasements to trap bed bugs and help detect infestationsUse pesticides if neededEnvironmental Protection Agency
Pressure Sores,https://medlineplus.gov/pressuresores.html,Pressure sores are areas of damaged skin caused by staying in one position for too long. They commonly form where your bones are close to your skin; such as your ankles; back; elbows; heels and hips. You are at risk if you are bedridden; use a wheelchair; or are unable to change your position. Pressure sores can cause serious infections; some of which are life-threatening. They can be a problem for people in nursing homes. You can prevent the sores by   Keeping skin clean and dry Changing position every two hours Using pillows and products that relieve pressure  Pressure sores have a variety of treatments. Advanced sores are slow to heal; so early treatment is best.
Bedwetting,https://medlineplus.gov/bedwetting.html,Many children wet the bed until they are 5 or even older. A child's bladder might be too small. Or the amount of urine produced overnight can be more than the bladder can hold. Some children sleep too deeply or take longer to learn bladder control. Stress can also be a factor. Children should not be punished for wetting the bed. They don't do it on purpose; and most outgrow it.Call the doctor if your child is 7 years old or older and wets the bed more than two or three times in a week. The doctor will look for and treat any other heath problems that could cause the bedwetting. Bedwetting alarms; bladder training; and medicines might help with the bedwetting.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Insect Bites and Stings,https://medlineplus.gov/insectbitesandstings.html,Most insect bites are harmless; though they sometimes cause discomfort. Bee; wasp; and hornet stings and fire ant bites usually hurt. Mosquito and flea bites usually itch. Insects can also spread diseases. In the United States; some mosquitoes spread West Nile virus. Travelers outside the United States may be at risk for malaria and other infections. To prevent insect bites and their complicationsDon't bother insectsUse insect repellant Wear protective clothing Be careful when you eat outside because food attracts insectsIf you know you have severe allergic reactions to insect bites and stings (such as anaphylaxis); carry an emergency epinephrine kit
Behcet's Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/behcetssyndrome.html,Behcet's syndrome is a disease that involves vasculitis; which is inflammation of the blood vessels. It causes problems in many parts of the body. The most common symptoms areSores in the mouthSores on the sex organs Other skin sores Swelling of parts of the eyePain; swelling and stiffness of the joints More serious problems can include meningitis; blood clots; inflammation of the digestive system and blindness. Doctors aren't sure what causes Behcet's. It is rare in the United States; but is common in the Middle East and Asia. It mainly affects people in their 20s and 30s. Diagnosing Behcet's can take a long time; because symptoms may come and go; and it may take months or even years to have all of the symptoms. There is no cure.  Treatment focuses on reducing pain and preventing serious problems. Most people can control symptoms with treatment.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Gas,https://medlineplus.gov/gas.html,Everyone has gas. Most people pass gas 13 to 21 times a day. Passing gas through the mouth is called belching or burping.  Passing gas through the anus is called flatulence. Most of the time gas does not have an odor. The odor comes from bacteria in the large intestine that release small amounts of gases that contain sulfur.Gas in the digestive tract comes from two sources: air that you swallow and the breakdown of undigested food by bacteria in the large intestine.  Certain foods may cause gas.  Foods that produce gas in one person may not cause gas in another.You can reduce the amount of gas you have byDrinking lots of water and non-fizzy drinksEating more slowly so you swallow less air when you eatAvoiding milk products if you have lactose intoleranceMedicines can help reduce gas or the pain and bloating caused by gas. If your symptoms still bother you; see your health care provider.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Benefits of Exercise,https://medlineplus.gov/benefitsofexercise.html,We have all heard it many times before - regular exercise is good for you; and it can help you lose weight. But if you are like many Americans; you are busy; you have a sedentary job; and you haven't yet changed your exercise habits. The good news is that it's never too late to start. You can start slowly; and find ways to fit more physical activity into your life. To get the most benefit; you should try to get the recommended amount of exercise for your age. If you can do it; the payoff is that you will feel better; help prevent or control many diseases; and likely even live longer. What are the health benefits of exercise?Regular exercise and physical activity mayHelp you control your weight. Along with diet; exercise plays an important role in controlling your weight and preventing obesity. To maintain your weight; the calories you eat and drink must equal the energy you burn. To lose weight; you must use more calories than you eat and drink.Reduce your risk of heart diseases. Exercise strengthens your heart and improves your circulation. The increased blood flow raises the oxygen levels in your body. This helps lower your risk of heart diseases such as high cholesterol; coronary artery disease; and heart attack.  Regular exercise can also lower your blood pressure and triglyceride levels. Help your body manage blood sugar and insulin levels.  Exercise can lower your blood sugar level and help your insulin work better. This can cut down your risk for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. And if you already have one of those diseases; exercise can help you to manage it. Help you quit smoking.  Exercise may make it easier to quit smoking by reducing your cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It can also help limit the weight you might gain when you stop smoking. Improve your mental health and mood.  During exercise; your body releases chemicals that can improve your mood and make you feel more relaxed. This can help you deal with stress and reduce your risk of depression. Help keep your thinking; learning; and judgment skills sharp as you age.  Exercise stimulates your body to release proteins and other chemicals that improve the structure and function of your brain. Strengthen your bones and muscles.  Regular exercise can help kids and teens build strong bones. Later in life; it can also slow the loss of bone density that comes with age. Doing muscle-strengthening activities can help you increase or maintain your muscle mass and strength. Reduce your risk of some cancers;  including colon; breast ; uterine; and lung cancer. Reduce your risk of falls.  For older adults; research shows that doing balance and muscle-strengthening activities in addition to moderate-intensity aerobic activity can help reduce your risk of falling. Improve your sleep.  Exercise can help you to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. Improve your sexual health.  Regular exercise may lower the risk of erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. For those who already have ED; exercise may help improve their sexual function. In women; exercise may increase sexual arousal. Increase your chances of living longer.  Studies show that physical activity can reduce your risk of dying early from the leading causes of death; like heart disease and some cancers. How can I make exercise a part of my regular routine?Make everyday activities more active. Even small changes can help. You can take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk down the hall to a coworker's office instead of sending an email. Wash the car yourself. Park further away from your destination. Be active with friends and family. Having a workout partner may make you more likely to enjoy exercise. You can also plan social activities that involve exercise. You might also consider joining an exercise group or class; such as a dance class; hiking club; or volleyball team. Keep track of your progress. Keeping a log of your activity or using a fitness tracker may help you set goals and stay motivated. Make exercise more fun. Try listening to music or watching TV while you exercise. Also; mix things up a little bit - if you stick with just one type of exercise; you might get bored. Try doing a combination of activities. Find activities that you can do even when the weather is bad.You can walk in a mall; climb stairs; or work out in a gym even if the weather stops you from exercising outside.
Enlarged Prostate (BPH),https://medlineplus.gov/enlargedprostatebph.html,The prostate is a gland in men. It helps make semen; the fluid that contains sperm. The prostate surrounds the tube that carries urine out of the body.  As men age; their prostate grows bigger. If it gets too large; it can cause problems.  An enlarged prostate is also called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Most men will get BPH as they get older.  Symptoms often start after age 50.BPH is not cancer; and it does not seem to increase your chance of getting prostate cancer.  But the early symptoms are the same. Check with your doctor if you haveA frequent and urgent need to urinate; especially at nightTrouble starting a urine stream or making more than a dribbleA urine stream that is weak; slow; or stops and starts several timesThe feeling that you still have to go; even just after urinatingSmall amounts of blood in your urineSevere BPH can cause serious problems over time; such as urinary tract infections; and bladder or kidney damage.  If it is found early; you are less likely to develop these problems.Tests for BPH include a digital rectal exam; blood and imaging tests; a urine flow study; and examination with a scope called a cystoscope. Treatments include watchful waiting; medicines; nonsurgical procedures; and surgery.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Benign Tumors,https://medlineplus.gov/benigntumors.html,Tumors are abnormal growths in your body. They can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. Benign tumors grow only in one place. They cannot spread or invade other parts of your body. Even so; they can be dangerous if they press on vital organs; such as your brain.Tumors are made up of extra cells. Normally; cells grow and divide to form new cells as your body needs them. When cells grow old; they die; and new cells take their place. Sometimes; this process goes wrong. New cells form when your body does not need them; and old cells do not die when they should. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form tumor.Treatment often involves surgery. Benign tumors usually don't grow back.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Bereavement,https://medlineplus.gov/bereavement.html,Bereavement is the period of grief and mourning after a death. When you grieve; it's part of the normal process of reacting to a loss. You may experience grief as a mental; physical; social or emotional reaction. Mental reactions can include anger; guilt; anxiety; sadness and despair. Physical reactions can include sleeping problems; changes in appetite; physical problems or illness.

Grief counseling or grief therapy is also helpful to some people.  NIH: National Cancer Institute
Brain Aneurysm,https://medlineplus.gov/brainaneurysm.html,A brain aneurysm is an abnormal bulge or "ballooning" in the wall of an artery in the brain. They are sometimes called berry aneurysms because they are often the size of a small berry. Most brain aneurysms produce no symptoms until they become large; begin to leak blood; or burst.If a brain aneurysm presses on nerves in your brain; it can cause signs and symptoms. These can includeA droopy eyelid Double vision or other changes in vision Pain above or behind the eye A dilated pupil Numbness or weakness on one side of the face or body Treatment depends on the size and location of the aneurysm; whether it is infected; and whether it has burst.

If possible; protect the injured part of your body with padding; a brace; or special equipment. When you do start playing again; start slowly.
Bile Duct Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/bileductcancer.html,Your liver makes a digestive juice called bile. Your gallbladder stores it between meals. When you eat; your gallbladder pushes the bile into tubes called bile ducts. They carry the bile to your small intestine. The bile helps break down fat. It also helps the liver get rid of toxins and wastes.Bile duct cancer is rare. It can happen in the parts of the bile ducts that are outside or inside the liver. Cancer of the bile duct outside of the liver is much more common. Risk factors include having inflammation of the bile duct; ulcerative colitis; and some liver diseases.Symptoms can includeJaundiceItchy skinFeverAbdominal painTests to diagnose bile duct cancer may include a physical exam; imaging tests of the liver and bile ducts; blood tests; and a biopsy.Treatments include surgery; radiation therapy; and chemotherapy.NIH: National Cancer Institute

Gallbladder Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/gallbladderdiseases.html,Your gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ under your liver. It stores bile; a fluid made by your liver to digest fat. As your stomach and intestines digest food; your gallbladder releases bile through a tube called the common bile duct. The duct connects your gallbladder and liver to your small intestine.Your gallbladder is most likely to give you trouble if something blocks the flow of bile through the bile ducts. That is usually a gallstone. Gallstones form when substances in bile harden. Rarely; you can also get cancer in your gallbladder.Many gallbladder problems get better with removal of the gallbladder. Fortunately; you can live without a gallbladder. Bile has other ways of reaching your small intestine.
Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse,https://medlineplus.gov/alcoholismandalcoholabuse.html,For most adults; moderate alcohol use is probably not harmful. However; about 18 million adult Americans have an alcohol use disorder (AUD).  This means that their drinking causes distress and harm.  It includes alcoholism and alcohol abuse.Alcoholism; or alcohol dependence; is a disease that causesCraving - a strong need to drinkLoss of control - not being able to stop drinking once you've startedPhysical dependence - withdrawal symptomsTolerance - the need to drink more alcohol to feel the same effectWith alcohol abuse; you are not physically dependent; but you still have a serious problem. The drinking may cause problems at home; work; or school. It may cause you to put yourself in dangerous situations; or lead to legal or social problems.Another common problem is binge drinking. It is drinking about five or more drinks in two hours for men.  For women; it is about four or more drinks in two hours.Too much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It can cause damage to the liver; brain; and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can harm your baby. Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes; injuries; homicide; and suicide.You may have an AUD if you can answer yes to two or more of these questions:In the past year; have youEnded up drinking more or for a longer time than you had planned to?Wanted to cut down or stop drinking; or tried to; but couldn't?Spent a lot of your time drinking; or recovering from drinking?Felt a strong need to drink?Found that drinking - or being sick from drinking - often interfered with your family life; job; or school?Kept drinking even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends?Given up or cut back on activities that you enjoyed just so you could drink?Gotten into dangerous situations while drinking or after drinking? Some examples are driving drunk and having unsafe sex.Kept drinking even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious? Or when it was adding to another health problem?Had to drink more and more to feel the effects of the alcohol?Had withdrawal symptoms when the alcohol was wearing off? They include trouble sleeping; shakiness; irritability; anxiety; depression; restlessness; nausea; and sweating. In severe cases; you could have a fever; seizures; or hallucinations.If you have any of these symptoms; your drinking may already be a cause for concern. The more symptoms you have; the more serious the problem is. If you think you might have an AUD; see your health care provider for an evaluation. Your provider can help make a treatment plan; prescribe medicines; and if needed; give you treatment referrals.NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
Eating Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eatingdisorders.html,Eating disorders are serious behavior problems. They can include severe overeating or not consuming enough food to stay healthy. They also involve extreme concern about your shape or weight.Types of eating disorders includeAnorexia nervosa; in which you become too thin; but you don't eat enough because you think you are fat Bulimia nervosa; which involves periods of overeating followed by purging; sometimes through self-induced vomiting or using laxativesBinge-eating; which is out-of-control eatingWomen are more likely than men to have eating disorders. They usually start in the teenage years and often occur along with depression; anxiety disorders; and substance abuse.Eating disorders can lead to heart and kidney problems and even death. Getting help early is important. Treatment involves monitoring; talk therapy; nutritional counseling; and sometimes medicines. NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
Biodefense and Bioterrorism,https://medlineplus.gov/biodefenseandbioterrorism.html,A bioterrorism attack is the deliberate release of viruses; bacteria; or other germs to cause illness or death. These germs are often found in nature. But they can sometimes be made more harmful by increasing their ability to cause disease; spread; or resist medical treatment.Biological agents spread through the air; water; or in food. Some can also spread from person to person. They can be very hard to detect. They don't cause illness for several hours or days. Scientists worry that anthrax; botulism; Ebola and other hemorrhagic fever viruses; plague; or smallpox could be used as biological agents.Biodefense uses medical measures to protect people against bioterrorism. This includes medicines and vaccinations. It also includes medical research and preparations to defend against bioterrorist attacks.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Medical Ethics,https://medlineplus.gov/medicalethics.html,The field of ethics studies principles of right and wrong. There is hardly an area in medicine that doesn't have an ethical aspect. For example; there are ethical issues relating toEnd of life care: Should a patient receive nutrition? What about advance directives and resuscitation orders?Abortion: When does life begin? Is it ethical to terminate a pregnancy with a birth defect?Genetic and prenatal testing: What happens if you are a carrier of a defect? What if testing shows that your unborn baby has a defect?Birth control: Should it be available to minors?Is it ethical to harvest embryonic stem cells to treat diseases?Organ donation: Must a relative donate an organ to a sick relative?Your personal health information: who has access to your records?Patient rights: Do you have the right to refuse treatment?When you talk with your doctor; is it ethical for her to withhold information from you or your family?

Biopsy,https://medlineplus.gov/biopsy.html,A biopsy is a procedure that removes cells or tissue from your body.  A doctor called a pathologist looks at the cells or tissue under a microscope to check for damage or disease. The pathologist may also do other tests on it.Biopsies can be done on all parts of the body. In most cases; a biopsy is the only test that can tell for sure if a suspicious area is cancer.  But biopsies are performed for many other reasons too.There are different types of biopsies. A needle biopsy removes tissue with a needle passed through your skin to the site of the problem. Other kinds of biopsies may require surgery.

Bird Flu,https://medlineplus.gov/birdflu.html,Birds; just like people; get the flu. Bird flu viruses infect birds; including chickens; other poultry; and wild birds such as ducks. Usually bird flu viruses only infect other birds. It is rare for people to get infected with bird flu viruses; but it can happen. Two types; H5N1 and H7N9; have infected some people during outbreaks in Asia; Africa; the Pacific; the Middle East; and parts of Europe. There have also been some rare cases of other types of bird flu affecting people in the United States.Most of the people who get bird flu have had close contact with infected birds or with surfaces that have been contaminated by the birds' saliva; mucous; or droppings. It is also possible to get it by breathing in droplets or dust that contain the virus. Rarely; the virus has spread from one person to another. It may also be possible to catch bird flu by eating poultry or eggs that are not well cooked.Bird flu illness in people can range from mild to severe. Often; the symptoms are similar to the seasonal flu; such asFeverCoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesFatigueHeadachesEye redness (or conjunctivitis)Difficulty breathingIn some cases; bird flu can cause serious complications and death. As with seasonal flu; some people are at higher risk for serious illness. They include pregnant women; people with weakened immune systems; and seniors aged 65 and older. Treatment with antiviral medicines may make the illness less severe. They may also help prevent the flu in people who were exposed to it. There is currently no vaccine available to the public. The government does have a supply of a vaccine for one type of H5N1 bird flu virus and could distribute it if there was an outbreak that spread easily from person to person.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Birth Control,https://medlineplus.gov/birthcontrol.html,Birth control; also known as contraception; is designed to prevent pregnancy. Birth control methods may work in a number of different ways:Preventing sperm from getting to the eggs. Types include condoms; diaphragms; cervical caps; and contraceptive sponges.Keeping the woman's ovaries from releasing eggs that could be fertilized. Types include birth control pills; patches; shots; vaginal rings; and emergency contraceptive pills.IUDs; devices which are implanted into the uterus. They can be kept in place for several years.Sterilization; which permanently prevents a woman from getting pregnant or a man from being able to get a woman pregnant Your choice of birth control should depend on several factors. These include your health; frequency of sexual activity; number of sexual partners and desire to have children in the future. Your health care provider can help you select the best form of birth control for you.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Birth Defects,https://medlineplus.gov/birthdefects.html,A birth defect is a problem that happens while a baby is developing in the mother's body.  Most birth defects happen during the first 3 months of pregnancy. One out of every 33 babies in the United States is born with a birth defect.A birth defect may affect how the body looks; works or both. Some birth defects like cleft lip or neural tube defects are structural problems that can be easy to see. To find others; like heart defects; doctors use special tests. Birth defects can range from mild to severe. Causes can includeGeneticsExposures to medicines or chemicals. For example; alcohol abuse can cause fetal alcohol syndrome.Infections during pregnancyCertain medicines. Before you get pregnant; talk to your health care provider about any medicines you take.Not getting enough of certain nutrients. For example; not getting enough folic acid before and during pregnancy is a key factor in causing neural tube defects.For most birth defects; the cause is unknown.Health care providers can diagnose certain birth defects during pregnancy; with prenatal tests.  That's why it important to get regular prenatal care. Other birth defects may not be found until after the baby is born. Sometimes the defect is obvious right away. Other times; the health care provider may not discover it until later in life.Babies with birth defects often need special care and treatments. The treatments may include surgery; medicines; assistive devices; and therapies.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Childbirth Problems,https://medlineplus.gov/childbirthproblems.html,While childbirth usually goes well; complications can happen.  They can cause a risk to the mother; baby; or both.  Possible complications includePreterm (premature) labor; when labor starts before 37 completed weeks of pregnancyProblems with the umbilical cordProblems with the position of the baby; such as breech; in which the baby is going to come out feet firstBirth injuriesFor some of these problems; the baby may need to be delivered surgically by a Cesarean section.
Birth Weight,https://medlineplus.gov/birthweight.html,Birth weight is the first weight of your baby; taken just after he or she is born.  A low birth weight is less than 5.5 pounds.  A high birth weight is more than 8.8 pounds.A low birth weight baby can be born too small; too early (premature); or both. This can happen for many different reasons.  They include health problems in the mother; genetic factors; problems with the placenta and substance abuse by the mother.Some low birth weight babies may be more at risk for certain health problems. Some may become sick in the first days of life or develop infections. Others may suffer from longer-term problems such as delayed motor and social development or learning disabilities.High birth weight babies are often big because the parents are big; or the mother has diabetes during pregnancy.  These babies may be at a higher risk of birth injuries and problems with blood sugar.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Birthmarks,https://medlineplus.gov/birthmarks.html,Birthmarks are abnormalities of the skin that are present when a baby is born. There are two types of birthmarks. Vascular birthmarks are made up of blood vessels that haven't formed correctly. They are usually red. Two types of vascular birthmarks are hemangiomas and port-wine stains.  Pigmented birthmarks are made of a cluster of pigment cells which cause color in skin. They can be many different colors; from tan to brown; gray to black; or even blue. Moles can be birthmarks.No one knows what causes many types of birthmarks; but some run in families. Your baby's doctor will look at the birthmark to see if it needs any treatment or if it should be watched. Pigmented birthmarks aren't usually treated; except for moles. Treatment for vascular birthmarks includes laser surgery. Most birthmarks are not serious; and some go away on their own. Some stay the same or get worse as you get older. Usually birthmarks are only a concern for your appearance. But certain types can increase your risk of skin cancer. If your birthmark bleeds; hurts; itches; or becomes infected; call your health care provider.
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Health,https://medlineplus.gov/gaylesbianbisexualandtransgenderhealth.html,Gay; lesbian; bisexual; and transgender individuals have special health concerns besides the usual ones that affect most men and women. On this page you'll find information about these specific health issues.
Spider Bites,https://medlineplus.gov/spiderbites.html,Though many people are afraid of spiders; they rarely bite people unless threatened.  Most spider bites are harmless.  Occasionally; spider bites can cause allergic reactions. And bites by the venomous black widow and brown recluse spiders can be very dangerous to people. If you are bitten by a spider; you may see a reaction similar to that of a bee sting; including redness; pain and swelling at the site. To treat a spider bite:   Wash the area well with soap and water Apply an ice pack or a wet compress to the area Take over-the-counter pain medicine; if needed Consider using antihistamines for severe swelling Seek medical treatment for small children and adults with severe symptoms
Bladder Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/bladdercancer.html,The bladder is a hollow organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine. Bladder cancer occurs in the lining of the bladder. It is the sixth most common type of cancer in the United States.Symptoms includeBlood in your urineA frequent urge to urinatePain when you urinateLow back painRisk factors for developing bladder cancer include smoking and exposure to certain chemicals in the workplace.  People with a family history of bladder cancer or who are older; white; or male have a higher risk.Treatments for bladder cancer include surgery; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; and biologic therapy. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Urinary Incontinence,https://medlineplus.gov/urinaryincontinence.html,Urinary incontinence (UI) is loss of bladder control. Symptoms can range from mild leaking to uncontrollable wetting. It can happen to anyone; but it becomes more common with age. Women experience UI twice as often as men.Most bladder control problems happen when muscles are too weak or too active. If the muscles that keep your bladder closed are weak; you may have accidents when you sneeze; laugh or lift a heavy object. This is stress incontinence. If bladder muscles become too active; you may feel a strong urge to go to the bathroom when you have little urine in your bladder. This is urge incontinence or overactive bladder.  There are other causes of incontinence; such as prostate problems and nerve damage.Treatment depends on the type of problem you have and what best fits your lifestyle. It may include simple exercises; medicines; special devices or procedures prescribed by your doctor; or surgery. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Bladder Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/bladderdiseases.html,The bladder is a hollow organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine. Many conditions can affect your bladder. Some common ones areCystitis - inflammation of the bladder; often from an infectionUrinary incontinence - loss of bladder controlOveractive bladder - a condition in which the bladder squeezes urine out at the wrong timeInterstitial cystitis - a chronic problem that causes bladder pain and frequent; urgent urinationBladder cancerDoctors diagnose bladder diseases using different tests. These include urine tests; x-rays; and an examination of the bladder wall with a scope called a cystoscope. Treatment depends on the cause of the problem. It may include medicines and; in severe cases; surgery. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Urinary Tract Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/urinarytractinfections.html,The urinary system is the body's drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. It includes two kidneys; two ureters; a bladder; and a urethra. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common type of infection in the body.You may have a UTI if you noticePain or burning when you urinateFever; tiredness; or shakinessAn urge to urinate oftenPressure in your lower belly Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy or reddishPain in your back or side below the ribsPeople of any age or sex can get UTIs. But about four times as many women get UTIs as men. You're also at higher risk if you have diabetes; need a tube to drain your bladder; or have a spinal cord injury.If you think you have a UTI it is important to see your doctor. Your doctor can tell if you have a UTI with a urine test.  Treatment is with antibiotics. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Interstitial Cystitis,https://medlineplus.gov/interstitialcystitis.html,Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a condition that causes discomfort or pain in the bladder and a need to urinate frequently and urgently. It is far more common in women than in men. The symptoms vary from person to person. Some people may have pain without urgency or frequency. Others have urgency and frequency without pain. Women's symptoms often get worse during their periods. They may also have pain with sexual intercourse.The cause of IC isn't known. There is no one test to tell if you have it.  Doctors often run tests to rule out other possible causes of symptoms. There is no cure for IC; but treatments can help most people feel better. They includeDistending; or inflating; the bladderBathing the inside of the bladder with a drug solutionOral medicinesElectrical nerve stimulationPhysical therapyLifestyle changesBladder trainingIn rare cases; surgeryNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Bleeding,https://medlineplus.gov/bleeding.html,Bleeding is the loss of blood. It can happen outside or inside the body. You may bleed when you get a cut or other wound. Bleeding can also be due to an injury to internal organs.Sometimes bleeding can cause other problems. A bruise is bleeding under the skin. Some strokes are caused by bleeding in the brain. Other bleeding; such as gastrointestinal bleeding; coughing up blood; or vaginal bleeding; can be a symptom of a disease.Normally; when you bleed; your blood forms clots to stop the bleeding.  Severe bleeding may require first aid or a trip to the emergency room. If you have a bleeding disorder; your blood does not form clots normally.
Bleeding Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/bleedingdisorders.html,Normally; if you get hurt; your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding. For blood to clot; your body needs cells called platelets and proteins known as clotting factors. If you have a bleeding disorder; you either do not have enough platelets or clotting factors or they don't work the way they should. Bleeding disorders can be the result of other diseases; such as severe liver disease or a lack of vitamin K. They can also be inherited. Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder. Bleeding disorders can also be a side effect of medicines such as blood thinners.Various blood tests can check for a bleeding disorder. You will also have a physical exam and history. Treatments depend on the cause. They may include medicines and transfusions of blood; platelets; or clotting factor.
Gastrointestinal Bleeding,https://medlineplus.gov/gastrointestinalbleeding.html,Your digestive or gastrointestinal (GI) tract includes the esophagus; stomach; small intestine; large intestine or colon; rectum; and anus. Bleeding can come from any of these areas. The amount of bleeding can be so small that only a lab test can find it. Signs of bleeding in the digestive tract depend where it is and how much bleeding there is.Signs of bleeding in the upper digestive tract includeBright red blood in vomitVomit that looks like coffee groundsBlack or tarry stoolDark blood mixed with stoolSigns of bleeding in the lower digestive tract includeBlack or tarry stoolDark blood mixed with stoolStool mixed or coated with bright red bloodGI bleeding is not a disease; but a symptom of a disease. There are many possible causes of GI bleeding; including hemorrhoids; peptic ulcers; tears or inflammation in the esophagus; diverticulosis and diverticulitis; ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; colonic polyps; or cancer in the colon; stomach or  esophagus.The test used most often to look for the cause of GI bleeding is called endoscopy. It uses a flexible instrument inserted through the mouth or rectum to view the inside of the GI tract. A type of endoscopy called colonoscopy looks at the large intestine.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Eyelid Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eyeliddisorders.html,Your eyelids help protect your eyes. When you blink; your eyelids spread moisture over your eyes. Blinking also helps move dirt or other particles off the surface of the eye.  You close your eyelids when you see something coming toward your eyes.  This can help protect against injuries.Like most other parts of your body; your eyelids can get infected; inflamed; or even develop cancer. There are also specific eyelid problems; includingEyelids that turn in or outEyelids that droopAbnormal blinking or twitchingTreatment of eyelid problems depends on the cause.
Vision Impairment and Blindness,https://medlineplus.gov/visionimpairmentandblindness.html,If you have low vision; eyeglasses; contact lenses; medicine; or surgery may not help. Activities like reading; shopping; cooking; writing; and watching TV may be hard to do.   The leading causes of low vision and blindness in the United States are age-related eye diseases: macular degeneration; cataract and glaucoma.  Other eye disorders; eye injuries; and birth defects can also cause vision loss. Whatever the cause; lost vision cannot be restored. It can; however; be managed. A loss of vision means that you may have to reorganize your life and learn new ways of doing things. If you have some vision; visual aids such as special glasses and large print books can make life easier. There are also devices to help those with no vision; like text-reading software and braille books.The sooner vision loss or eye disease is found and treated; the greater your chances of keeping your remaining vision. You should have regular comprehensive eye exams by an eye care professional.NIH: National Eye Institute
Blisters,https://medlineplus.gov/blisters.html,What are blisters?Blisters are fluid-filled sacs on the outer layer of your skin. They form because of rubbing; heat; or diseases of the skin. They are most common on your hands and feet.Other names for blisters are vesicles (usually for smaller blisters) and bulla (for larger blisters).How do you get blisters?Blisters often happen when there is friction - rubbing or pressure - on one spot. For example; if your shoes don't fit quite right and they keep rubbing part of your foot. Or if you don't wear gloves when you rake leaves and the handle keeps rubbing against your hand. Other causes of blisters includeBurnsSunburnFrostbiteEczemaAllergic reactionsPoison ivy; oak; and sumacAutoimmune diseases such as pemphigusEpidermolysis bullosa; an illness that causes the skin to be fragileViral infections such as varicella zoster (which causes chickenpox and shingles) and herpes simplex (which causes cold sores)Skin infections including impetigoWhat are the treatments for blisters?Blisters will usually heal on their own. The skin over the blister helps keep out infections. You can put a bandage on the blister to keep it clean.  Make sure that there is no more rubbing or friction on the blister.You should contact your health care provider ifThe blister looks infected - if it is draining pus; or the area around the blister is red; swollen; warm; or very painfulYou have a feverYou have several blisters; especially if you cannot figure out what is causing themYou have health problems such as circulation problems or diabetesNormally you don't want to drain a blister; because of the risk of infection. But if a blister is large; painful; or looks like it will pop on its own; you can drain the fluid.How can I prevent blisters?There are some things you can do to prevent friction blisters:Make sure that your shoes fit properlyAlways wear socks with your shoes; and make sure that the socks fit well. You may want to wear socks that are acrylic or nylon; so they keep moisture away from your feet.Wear gloves or protective gear on your hands when you use any tools or sports equipment that cause friction.
Blood,https://medlineplus.gov/blood.html,Your blood is made up of liquid and solids. The liquid part; called plasma; is made of water; salts; and protein. Over half of your blood is plasma. The solid part of your blood contains red blood cells; white blood cells; and platelets.Red blood cells (RBC) deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs. White blood cells (WBC) fight infection and are part of your immune system. Platelets help blood to clot when you have a cut or wound. Bone marrow; the spongy material inside your bones; makes new blood cells. Blood cells constantly die and your body makes new ones. Red blood cells live about 120 days; and platelets live about 6 days. Some white blood cells live less than a day; but others live much longer.There are four blood types: A; B; AB; or O. Also; blood is either Rh-positive or Rh-negative. So if you have type A blood; it's either A positive or A negative. Which type you are is important if you need a blood transfusion. And your Rh factor could be important if you become pregnant - an incompatibility between your type and the baby's could create problems. Blood tests such as blood count tests help doctors check for certain diseases and conditions. They also help check the function of your organs and show how well treatments are working. Problems with your blood may include bleeding disorders; excessive clotting and platelet disorders. If you lose too much blood; you may need a transfusion.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

Blood Count Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodcounttests.html,Your blood contains red blood cells (RBC); white blood cells (WBC); and platelets. Blood count tests measure the number and types of cells in your blood. This helps doctors check on your overall health. The tests can also help to diagnose diseases and conditions such as anemia; infections; clotting problems; blood cancers; and immune system disorders.Specific types include tests forRBC - the numbers; size; and types of RBC in the bloodWBC - the numbers and types of WBC in the bloodPlatelets - the numbers and size of the plateletsHemoglobin - an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygenHematocrit - how much space red blood cells take up in your bloodReticulocyte count - how many young red blood cells are in your bloodMean corpuscular volume (MCV) - the average size of your red blood cellsThe complete blood count (CBC) includes most or all of these. The CBC is one of the most common blood tests.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Blood Clots,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodclots.html,Normally; if you get hurt; your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding. After the bleeding stops and healing takes place; your body usually breaks down and removes the clot. But some people get too many clots or their blood clots abnormally. Many conditions can cause the blood to clot too much or prevent blood clots from dissolving properly.Risk factors for excessive blood clotting includeCertain genetic disordersAtherosclerosisDiabetesAtrial fibrillationOverweight; obesity; and metabolic syndromeSome medicinesSmokingStaying in one position for a long time; such as being in the hospital or taking a long car or plane rideCancer and cancer treatmentsBlood clots can form in; or travel to; the blood vessels in the brain; heart; kidneys; lungs; and limbs. A clot in the veins deep in the limbs is called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT usually affects the deep veins of the legs. If a blood clot in a deep vein breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs and blocks blood flow; it is called a pulmonary embolism. Other complications of blood clots include stroke; heart attack; kidney problems; kidney failure; and pregnancy-related problems.Treatments for blood clots include blood thinners and other medicines.
Pulmonary Embolism,https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryembolism.html,A pulmonary embolism is a sudden blockage in a lung artery.  The cause is usually a blood clot in the leg called a deep vein thrombosis that breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lung. Pulmonary embolism is a serious condition that can causePermanent damage to the affected lung Low oxygen levels in your blood Damage to other organs in your body from not getting enough oxygen If a clot is large; or if there are many clots; pulmonary embolism can cause death.  Half the people who have pulmonary embolism have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms; they can include shortness of breath; chest pain or coughing up blood. Symptoms of a blood clot include warmth; swelling; pain; tenderness and redness of the leg. The goal of treatment is to break up clots and help keep other clots from forming.

Hemophilia,https://medlineplus.gov/hemophilia.html,Hemophilia is a rare disorder in which the blood does not clot normally.  It is usually inherited. Hemophilia usually occurs in males.If you have hemophilia; you have little or no clotting factor. Clotting factor is a protein needed for normal blood clotting. Without it; you may bleed for a long time after an injury or accident. You also may bleed into your knees; ankles; and elbows. Bleeding in the joints causes pain and; if not treated; can lead to arthritis. Bleeding in the brain; a very serious complication of hemophilia; requires emergency treatment.The main symptoms of hemophilia are excessive bleeding and easy bruising. Blood tests can tell if you have it.  The main treatment is injecting the missing clotting factor into the bloodstream. You may need it on a regular basis; or just when bleeding occurs.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Blood Count Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodcounttests.html,Your blood contains red blood cells (RBC); white blood cells (WBC); and platelets. Blood count tests measure the number and types of cells in your blood. This helps doctors check on your overall health. The tests can also help to diagnose diseases and conditions such as anemia; infections; clotting problems; blood cancers; and immune system disorders.Specific types include tests forRBC - the numbers; size; and types of RBC in the bloodWBC - the numbers and types of WBC in the bloodPlatelets - the numbers and size of the plateletsHemoglobin - an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygenHematocrit - how much space red blood cells take up in your bloodReticulocyte count - how many young red blood cells are in your bloodMean corpuscular volume (MCV) - the average size of your red blood cellsThe complete blood count (CBC) includes most or all of these. The CBC is one of the most common blood tests.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Blood Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/blooddisorders.html,Your blood is living tissue made up of liquid and solids. The liquid part; called plasma; is made of water; salts and protein. Over half of your blood is plasma. The solid part of your blood contains red blood cells; white blood cells and platelets.Blood disorders affect one or more parts of the blood and prevent your blood from doing its job.  They can be acute or chronic. Many blood disorders are inherited. Other causes include other diseases; side effects of medicines; and a lack of certain nutrients in your diet.Types of blood disorders includePlatelet disorders; excessive clotting; and bleeding problems; which affect how your blood clotsAnemia; which happens when your blood does not carry enough oxygen to the rest of your bodyCancers of the blood; such as leukemia and myelomaEosinophilic disorders; which are problems with one type of white blood cell.
Blood Transfusion and Donation,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodtransfusionanddonation.html,Every year; millions of people in the United States receive life-saving blood transfusions.  During a transfusion; you receive whole blood or parts of blood such as Red blood cells - cells that carry oxygen to and from tissues and organsPlatelets - cells that form clots to control bleedingPlasma - the liquid part of the blood that helps clotting. You may need it if you have been badly burned; have liver failure or a severe infection.Most blood transfusions go very smoothly.  Some infectious agents; such as HIV; can survive in blood and infect the person receiving the blood transfusion. To keep blood safe; blood banks carefully screen donated blood. The risk of catching a virus from a blood transfusion is low.Sometimes it is possible to have a transfusion of your own blood. During surgery; you may need a blood transfusion because of blood loss. If you are having a surgery that you're able to schedule months in advance; your doctor may ask whether you would like to use your own blood; instead of donated blood. If so; you will need to have blood drawn one or more times before the surgery. A blood bank will store your blood for your use.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Blood Sugar,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodsugar.html,Blood sugar; or glucose; is the main sugar found in your blood. It comes from the food you eat; and is your body's main source of energy. Your blood carries glucose to all of your body's cells to use for energy.Diabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar levels are too high. Over time; having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems.  Even if you don't have diabetes; sometimes you may have problems with blood sugar that is too low or too high.  Keeping a regular schedule of eating; activity; and taking any medicines you need can help.If you do have diabetes; it is very important to keep your blood sugar numbers in your target range. You may need to check your blood sugar several times each day. Your health care provider will also do a blood test called an A1C. It checks your average blood sugar level over the past three months. If your blood sugar is too high; you may need to take medicines and/or follow a special diet.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Platelet Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/plateletdisorders.html,Platelets are little pieces of blood cells. Platelets help wounds heal and prevent bleeding by forming blood clots. Your bone marrow makes platelets.  Problems can result from having too few or too many platelets; or from platelets that do not work properly.If your blood has a low number of platelets; it is called thrombocytopenia. This can put you at risk for mild to serious bleeding.   If your blood has too many platelets; you may have a higher risk of blood clots.  With other platelet disorders; the platelets do not work as they should.  For example; in von Willebrand Disease; the platelets cannot stick together or cannot attach to blood vessel walls.  This can cause excessive bleeding.  Treatment of platelet disorders depends on the cause.  NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Sepsis,https://medlineplus.gov/sepsis.html,Sepsis is a serious illness. It happens when your body has an overwhelming immune response to a bacterial infection.  The chemicals released into the blood to fight the infection trigger widespread inflammation. This leads to blood clots and leaky blood vessels. They cause poor blood flow; which deprives your body's organs of nutrients and oxygen. In severe cases; one or more organs fail. In the worst cases; blood pressure drops and the heart weakens; leading to septic shock.Anyone can get sepsis; but the risk is higher inPeople with weakened immune systemsInfants and childrenThe elderlyPeople with chronic illnesses; such as diabetes; AIDS; cancer; and kidney or liver diseasePeople suffering from a severe burn or physical traumaCommon symptoms of sepsis are fever; chills; rapid breathing and heart rate; rash; confusion; and disorientation. Doctors diagnose sepsis using a blood test to see if the number of white blood cells is abnormal. They also do lab tests that check for signs of infection.People with sepsis are usually treated in hospital intensive care units. Doctors try to treat the infection; sustain the vital organs; and prevent a drop in blood pressure. Many patients receive oxygen and intravenous (IV) fluids. Other types of treatment; such as respirators or kidney dialysis; may be necessary. Sometimes; surgery is needed to clear up an infection.NIH: National Institute of General Medical Sciences
High Blood Pressure,https://medlineplus.gov/highbloodpressure.html,Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats; it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats; pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest; between beats; your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. A reading of119/79 or lower is normal blood pressure140/90 or higher is high blood pressureBetween 120 and 139 for the top number; or between 80 and 89 for the bottom number is called prehypertension. Prehypertension means you may end up with high blood pressure; unless you take steps to prevent it.High blood pressure usually has no symptoms; but it can cause serious problems such as stroke; heart failure; heart attack and kidney failure.You can control high blood pressure through healthy lifestyle habits such as exercise and the DASH diet and taking medicines; if needed. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Low Blood Pressure,https://medlineplus.gov/lowbloodpressure.html,You've probably heard that high blood pressure is a problem. Sometimes blood pressure that is too low can also cause problems.Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats; it pumps out blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats; pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest; between beats; your blood pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually they're written one above or before the other; such as 120/80. If your blood pressure reading is 90/60 or lower; you have low blood pressure. Some people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no symptoms and their low readings are normal for them. In other people; blood pressure drops below normal because of a medical condition or certain medicines. Some people may have symptoms of low blood pressure when standing up too quickly.  Low blood pressure is a problem only if it causes dizziness; fainting or in extreme cases; shock. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Vital Signs,https://medlineplus.gov/vitalsigns.html,Your vital signs show how well your body is functioning. They are usually measured at doctor's offices; often as part of a health checkup; or during an emergency room visit. They includeBlood pressure; which measures the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Blood pressure that is too high or too low can cause problems. Your blood pressure has two numbers. The first number is the pressure when your heart beats and is pumping the blood.  The second is from when your heart is at rest; between beats. A normal blood pressure reading for adults is lower than 120/80 and higher than 90/60.Heart rate; or pulse; which measures how fast your heart is beating. A problem with your heart rate may be an arrhythmia. Your normal heart rate depends on factors such as your age; how much you exercise; whether you are sitting or standing; which medicines you take; and your weight.Respiratory rate; which measures your breathing. Mild breathing changes can be from causes such as a stuffy nose or hard exercise. But slow or fast breathing can also be a sign of a serious breathing problem.Temperature; which measures how hot your body is. A body temperature that is higher than normal (over 98.6 degrees F) is called a fever.
Blood Pressure Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodpressuremedicines.html,High blood pressure; also called hypertension; usually has no symptoms. But it can cause serious problems such as stroke; heart failure; heart attack and kidney failure. If you cannot control your high blood pressure through lifestyle changes such as losing weight and reducing sodium in your diet; you may need medicines.Blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure. Some remove extra fluid and salt from the body. Others slow down the heartbeat or relax and widen blood vessels. Often; two or more medicines work better than one.

The tests can also help to diagnose diseases and conditions such as anemia; infections; clotting problems; blood cancers; and immune system disorders.Specific types include tests forRBC - the numbers; size; and types of RBC in the bloodWBC - the numbers and types of WBC in the bloodPlatelets - the numbers and size of the plateletsHemoglobin - an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygenHematocrit - how much space red blood cells take up in your bloodReticulocyte count - how many young red blood cells are in your bloodMean corpuscular volume (MCV) - the average size of your red blood cellsThe complete blood count (CBC) includes most or all of these. The CBC is one of the most common blood tests.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Laboratory Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/laboratorytests.html,Laboratory tests check a sample of your blood; urine; or body tissues. A technician or your doctor analyzes the test samples to see if your results fall within the normal range. The tests use a range because what is normal differs from person to person. Many factors affect test results. These includeYour sex; age and raceWhat you eat and drinkMedicines you takeHow well you followed pre-test instructionsYour doctor may also compare your results to results from previous tests. Laboratory tests are often part of a routine checkup to look for changes in your health. They also help doctors diagnose medical conditions; plan or evaluate treatments; and monitor diseases.
Blood Thinners,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodthinners.html,Blood thinners are medicines that prevent blood clots from forming. They also keep existing blood clots from getting larger. Clots in your arteries; veins; and heart can cause heart attacks; strokes; and blockages. You may take a blood thinner if you have Certain heart or blood vessel diseasesAn abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillationA heart valve replacementA risk of blood clots after surgeryCongenital heart defectsThere are two main types of blood thinners.  Anticoagulants such as heparin or warfarin (also called Coumadin) slow down your body's process of making clots. Antiplatelet drugs; such as aspirin; prevent blood cells called platelets from clumping together to form a clot.When you take a blood thinner; follow directions carefully. Blood thinners may interact with certain foods; medicines; vitamins; and alcohol. Make sure that your healthcare provider knows all of the medicines and supplements you are using. You will probably need regular blood tests to check how well your blood is clotting. It is important to make sure that you're taking enough medicine to prevent clots; but not so much that it causes bleeding.
Blood Transfusion and Donation,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodtransfusionanddonation.html,Every year; millions of people in the United States receive life-saving blood transfusions.  During a transfusion; you receive whole blood or parts of blood such as Red blood cells - cells that carry oxygen to and from tissues and organsPlatelets - cells that form clots to control bleedingPlasma - the liquid part of the blood that helps clotting. You may need it if you have been badly burned; have liver failure or a severe infection.Most blood transfusions go very smoothly.  Some infectious agents; such as HIV; can survive in blood and infect the person receiving the blood transfusion. To keep blood safe; blood banks carefully screen donated blood. The risk of catching a virus from a blood transfusion is low.Sometimes it is possible to have a transfusion of your own blood. During surgery; you may need a blood transfusion because of blood loss. If you are having a surgery that you're able to schedule months in advance; your doctor may ask whether you would like to use your own blood; instead of donated blood. If so; you will need to have blood drawn one or more times before the surgery. A blood bank will store your blood for your use.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Infection Control,https://medlineplus.gov/infectioncontrol.html,Every year; lives are lost because of the spread of infections in hospitals. Health care workers can take steps to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. These steps are part of infection control.Proper hand washing is the most effective way to prevent the spread of infections in hospitals. If you are a patient; don't be afraid to remind friends; family and health care providers to wash their hands before getting close to you.Other steps health care workers can take includeCovering coughs and sneezesStaying up-to-date with immunizationsUsing gloves; masks and protective clothingMaking tissues and hand cleaners available Following hospital guidelines when dealing with blood or contaminated items
Occupational Health for Health Care Providers,https://medlineplus.gov/occupationalhealthforhealthcareproviders.html,Health care workers are exposed to many job hazards. These can include InfectionsNeedle injuriesBack injuriesAllergy-causing substancesViolenceStressFollow good job safety and injury prevention practices. They can reduce your risk of health problems. Use protective equipment; follow infection control guidelines; learn the right way to lift heavy objects; and find ways to manage stress. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Body Weight,https://medlineplus.gov/bodyweight.html, Do you know if your current weight is healthy?  "Underweight"; "normal"; "overweight"; and "obese" are all labels for ranges of weight. Obese and overweight mean that your weight is greater than it should be for your health. Underweight means that it is lower than it should be for your health. Your healthy body weight depends on your sex and height. For children; it also depends on your age.A sudden; unexpected change in weight can be a sign of a medical problem.  Causes for sudden weight loss can includeThyroid problemsCancerInfectious diseasesDigestive diseasesCertain medicinesSudden weight gain can be due to medicines; thyroid problems; heart failure; and kidney disease.Good nutrition and exercise can help in losing weight. Eating extra calories within a well-balanced diet and treating any underlying medical problems can help to add weight.
Weight Control,https://medlineplus.gov/weightcontrol.html,Keeping a healthy weight is crucial.  If you are underweight or overweight; or have obesity; you may have a higher risk of certain health problems.About two thirds of adults in the U.S. are overweight or have obesity. Achieving a healthy weight can help you control your cholesterol; blood pressure and blood sugar. It might also help you prevent weight-related diseases; such as heart disease; diabetes; arthritis and some cancers. Eating too much or not being physically active enough will make you overweight. To maintain your weight; the calories you eat must equal the energy you burn. To lose weight; you must use more calories than you eat. A weight-control strategy might includeChoosing low-fat; low-calorie foodsEating smaller portionsDrinking water instead of sugary drinksBeing physically activeEating extra calories within a well-balanced diet can help to add weight.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Piercing and Tattoos,https://medlineplus.gov/piercingandtattoos.html,Piercings and tattoos are body decorations that go back to ancient times. Body piercing involves making a hole in the skin so that you can insert jewelry. This is often in the earlobe; but can be in other parts of the body. Tattoos are designs on the skin made with needles and colored ink. A permanent tattoo is meant to last forever. Permanent makeup is a type of tattoo. The health risks of piercings and tattoos includeAllergic reactions Keloids; a type of scar that forms during healingInfections; such as hepatitis To reduce the risks; make sure that the facility is clean; safe and has a good reputation. Proper sterilization of the equipment is important. Be sure to follow the instructions on caring for your skin. Holes from piercing usually close up if you no longer wear the jewelry. It is possible to remove tattoos; but it's painful and can cause scarring.
Lice,https://medlineplus.gov/lice.html,Lice are parasitic insects that can be found on people's heads and bodies. They survive by feeding on human blood. Lice found on each area of the body are different from each other. The three types of lice that live on humans are head lice; body  lice (also called clothes lice); and pubic lice ("crabs"). Symptoms of lice may include Intense itching Rash Visible nits (lice eggs) or crawling lice   Lice spread most commonly by close person-to-person contact. Dogs; cats; and other pets do not spread human lice. Lice move by crawling. They cannot hop or fly. If you get lice; both over-the-counter and prescription medicines are available for treatment. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Germs and Hygiene,https://medlineplus.gov/germsandhygiene.html,When you cough or sneeze; you send tiny germ-filled droplets into the air.  Colds and flu usually spread that way. You can help stop the spread of germs byCovering your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough. Sneeze or cough into your elbow; not your hands.Cleaning your hands often - always before you eat or prepare food; and after you use the bathroom or change a diaper Avoiding touching your eyes; nose or mouthHand washing is one of the most effective and most overlooked ways to stop disease. Soap and water work well to kill germs. Wash for at least 20 seconds and rub your hands briskly.  Disposable hand wipes or gel sanitizers also work well.
Sweat,https://medlineplus.gov/sweat.html,Sweat is a clear; salty liquid produced by glands in your skin. Sweating is how your body cools itself. You sweat mainly under your arms and on your feet and palms. When sweat mixes with bacteria on your skin; it can cause a smell. Bathing regularly and using antiperspirants or deodorants can help control the odor. Sweating a lot is normal when it is hot or when you exercise; are anxious; or have a fever. It also happens during menopause. If you often sweat too much; it's called hyperhidrosis. Causes include thyroid or nervous system disorders; low blood sugar; or another health problem. Sweating too little; anhidrosis; can be life-threatening because your body can overheat. Causes of anhidrosis include dehydration; burns; and some skin and nerve disorders.

Bone Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/bonecancer.html,Cancer that starts in a bone is uncommon.  Cancer that has spread to the bone from another part of the body is more common. There are three types of bone cancer:Osteosarcoma - occurs most often between ages 10 and 19. It is more common in the knee and upper arm.Chondrosarcoma - starts in cartilage; usually after age 40Ewing's sarcoma - occurs most often in children and teens under 19. It is more common in boys than girls.The most common symptom of bone cancer is pain. Other symptoms vary; depending on the location and size of the cancer. Surgery is often the main treatment for bone cancer. Other treatments may include amputation; chemotherapy; and radiation therapy. Because bone cancer can come back after treatment; regular follow-up visits are important.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Bone Density,https://medlineplus.gov/bonedensity.html,Strong bones are important for your health. A bone mineral density (BMD) test is the best way to measure your bone health. It compares your bone density; or mass; to that of a healthy person who is the same age and sex as you are. It can showWhether you have osteoporosis; a disease that makes your bones weakYour risk for breaking bonesWhether your osteoporosis treatment is workingLow bone mass that is not low enough to be osteoporosis is sometimes called osteopenia. Causes of low bone mass include family history; not developing good bone mass when you are young; and certain conditions or medicines. Not everyone who has low bone mass gets osteoporosis; but they are at higher risk for getting it.If you have low bone mass; there are things you can do to help slow down bone loss. These include eating foods rich in calcium and vitamin D and doing weight-bearing exercise such as walking; tennis; or dancing. In some cases; your doctor may prescribe medicines to prevent osteoporosis.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Bone Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/bonediseases.html,Your bones help you move; give you shape and support your body. They are living tissues that rebuild constantly throughout your life. During childhood and your teens; your body adds new bone faster than it removes old bone. After about age 20; you can lose bone faster than you make bone. To have strong bones when you are young; and to prevent bone loss when you are older; you need to get enough calcium; vitamin D; and exercise. You should also avoid smoking and drinking too much alcohol.Bone diseases can make bones easy to break. Different kinds of bone problems includeLow bone density and osteoporosis; which make your bones weak and more likely to break Osteogenesis imperfecta makes your bones brittle Paget's disease of bone makes them weak Bones can also develop cancer and infections Other bone diseases; which are caused by poor nutrition; genetics; or problems with the rate of bone growth or rebuildingNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Bone Grafts,https://medlineplus.gov/bonegrafts.html,A bone graft transplants bone tissue. Surgeons use bone grafts to repair and rebuild diseased bones in your hips; knees; spine; and sometimes other bones and joints. Grafts can also repair bone loss caused by some types of fractures or cancers. Once your body accepts the bone graft; it provides a framework for growth of new; living bone.If the transplanted bone comes from another person; it is called an allograft. Most allograft bone comes from donors who have died. Tissue banks screen these donors and disinfect and test the donated bone to make sure it is safe to use. If the transplanted bone comes from another part of your own body; it is called an autograft. Autograft bone often comes from your ribs; hips or a leg.
Bone Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/boneinfections.html,Like other parts of the body; bones can get infected. The infections are usually bacterial; but can also be fungal. They may spread to the bone from nearby skin or muscles; or from another part of the body through the bloodstream. People who are at risk for bone infections include those with diabetes; poor circulation; or recent injury to the bone. You may also be at risk if you are having hemodialysis.  Symptoms of bone infections include  Pain in the infected area Chills and fever Swelling; warmth; and redness  A blood test or imaging test such as an x-ray can tell if you have a bone infection. Treatment includes antibiotics and often surgery.
Bone Density,https://medlineplus.gov/bonedensity.html,Strong bones are important for your health. A bone mineral density (BMD) test is the best way to measure your bone health.

Osteoporosis,https://medlineplus.gov/osteoporosis.html,Osteoporosis is a disease that thins and weakens the bones. Your bones become fragile and break easily; especially the bones in the hip; spine; and wrist. In the United States; millions of people either already have osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass.Anyone can develop osteoporosis; but it is more common in older women. Risk factors includeGetting older Being small and thin Having a family history of osteoporosisTaking certain medicinesBeing a white or Asian womanHaving low bone densityOsteoporosis is a silent disease. You might not know you have it until you break a bone. A bone mineral density test is the best way to check your bone health.To keep bones strong; eat a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D; exercise; and do not smoke. If needed; medicines can also help. It is also important to try to avoid falling down. Falls are the number one cause of fractures in older adults.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Bone Marrow Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/bonemarrowdiseases.html,Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside some of your bones; such as your hip and thigh bones. It contains stem cells. The stem cells can develop into the red blood cells that carry oxygen through your body; the white blood cells that fight infections; and the platelets that help with blood clotting.With bone marrow disease; there are problems with the stem cells or how they develop:In leukemia; a cancer of the blood; the bone marrow makes abnormal white blood cellsIn aplastic anemia; the bone marrow doesn't make red blood cellsIn myeloproliferative disorders; the bone marrow makes too many white blood cellsOther diseases; such as lymphoma; can spread into the bone marrow and affect the production of blood cellsCauses of bone marrow diseases include genetics and environmental factors. Tests for bone marrow diseases include blood and bone marrow tests. Treatments depend on the disorder and how severe it is. They might involve medicines; blood transfusions or a bone marrow transplant.
Bone Marrow Transplantation,https://medlineplus.gov/bonemarrowtransplantation.html,Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside some of your bones; such as your hip and thigh bones. It contains immature cells; called stem cells. The stem cells can develop into red blood cells; which carry oxygen throughout the body; white blood cells; which fight infections; and platelets; which help the blood to clot.A bone marrow transplant is a procedure that replaces a person's faulty bone marrow stem cells. Doctors use these transplants to treat people with certain diseases; such asLeukemiaSevere blood diseases such as thalassemias; aplastic anemia; and sickle cell anemiaMultiple myelomaCertain immune deficiency diseasesBefore you have a transplant; you need to get high doses of chemotherapy and possibly radiation. This destroys the faulty stem cells in your bone marrow. It also suppresses your body's immune system so that it won't attack the new stem cells after the transplant.In some cases; you can donate your own bone marrow stem cells in advance. The cells are saved and then used later on. Or you can get cells from a donor. The donor might be a family member or unrelated person.Bone marrow transplantation has serious risks. Some complications can be life-threatening. But for some people; it is the best hope for a cure or a longer life.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

Personality Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/personalitydisorders.html,Personality disorders are a group of mental illnesses. They involve long-term patterns of thoughts and behaviors that are unhealthy and inflexible. The behaviors cause serious problems with relationships and work.  People with personality disorders have trouble dealing with everyday stresses and problems.  They often have stormy relationships with other people.The cause of personality disorders is unknown. However; genes and childhood experiences may play a role.The symptoms of each personality disorder are different. They can mild or severe.  People with personality disorders may have trouble realizing that they have a problem. To them; their thoughts are normal; and they often blame others for their problems. They may try to get help because of their problems with relationships and work.  Treatment usually includes talk therapy and sometimes medicine.
Herbal Medicine,https://medlineplus.gov/herbalmedicine.html,An herb is a plant or plant part used for its scent; flavor; or therapeutic properties. Herbal medicines are one type of dietary supplement. They are sold as tablets; capsules; powders; teas; extracts; and fresh or dried plants. People use herbal medicines to try to maintain or improve their health.Many people believe that products labeled "natural" are always safe and good for them. This is not necessarily true. Herbal medicines do not have to go through the testing that drugs do. Some herbs; such as comfrey and ephedra; can cause serious harm. Some herbs can interact with prescription or over-the-counter medicines.If you are thinking about using an herbal medicine; first get information on it from reliable sources. Make sure to tell your health care provider about any herbal medicines you are taking.NIH: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health
Botox,https://medlineplus.gov/botox.html,Botox is a drug made from a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum.  It's the same toxin that causes a life-threatening type of food poisoning called botulism. Doctors use it in small doses to treat health problems; includingTemporary smoothing of facial wrinkles and improving your appearanceSevere underarm sweating Cervical dystonia - a neurological disorder that causes severe neck and shoulder muscle contractions Blepharospasm - uncontrollable blinking  Strabismus - misaligned eyes Chronic migraineOveractive bladderBotox injections work by weakening or paralyzing certain muscles or by blocking certain nerves. The effects last about three to twelve months; depending on what you are treating. The most common side effects are pain; swelling; or bruising at the injection site.  You could also have flu-like symptoms; headache; and upset stomach.  Injections in the face may also cause temporary drooping eyelids. You should not use Botox if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

Botulism,https://medlineplus.gov/botulism.html,Botulism is a rare but serious illness. The cause is a toxin (poison) made by a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum. It occurs naturally in soil. There are several kinds of botulism.  Foodborne  botulism comes from eating foods contaminated with the toxin. Wound botulism happens when a wound infected with the bacteria makes the toxin. It is more common in heroin users. Infant botulism happens when a baby consumes the spores of the bacteria from soil or honey.  All forms can be deadly and are medical emergencies.Symptoms include double or blurred vision; drooping eyelids; slurred speech; difficulty swallowing; dry mouth; and muscle weakness. Treatment may include antitoxins; intensive medical care; or surgery of infected wounds.To prevent botulism:Be very careful when canning foods at homeDo not let babies eat honeyGet prompt medical care for infected woundsCenters for Disease Control and Prevention

NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Bowel Movement,https://medlineplus.gov/bowelmovement.html,A bowel movement is the last stop in the movement of food through your digestive tract. Your stool passes out of your body through the rectum and anus.  Another name for stool is feces.  It is made of what is left after your digestive system (stomach; small intestine; and colon) absorbs nutrients and fluids from what you eat and drink.Sometimes a bowel movement isn't normal.  Diarrhea happens when stool passes through the large intestine too quickly. Constipation occurs when stool passes through the large intestine too slowly. Bowel incontinence is a problem controlling your bowel movements. Other abnormalities with bowel movements may be a sign of a digestive problem.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Intestinal Obstruction,https://medlineplus.gov/intestinalobstruction.html,An intestinal obstruction occurs when food or stool cannot move through the intestines.

It often requires surgery. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Enlarged Prostate (BPH),https://medlineplus.gov/enlargedprostatebph.html,The prostate is a gland in men. It helps make semen; the fluid that contains sperm. The prostate surrounds the tube that carries urine out of the body.  As men age; their prostate grows bigger. If it gets too large; it can cause problems.  An enlarged prostate is also called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Most men will get BPH as they get older.  Symptoms often start after age 50.BPH is not cancer; and it does not seem to increase your chance of getting prostate cancer.  But the early symptoms are the same. Check with your doctor if you haveA frequent and urgent need to urinate; especially at nightTrouble starting a urine stream or making more than a dribbleA urine stream that is weak; slow; or stops and starts several timesThe feeling that you still have to go; even just after urinatingSmall amounts of blood in your urineSevere BPH can cause serious problems over time; such as urinary tract infections; and bladder or kidney damage.  If it is found early; you are less likely to develop these problems.Tests for BPH include a digital rectal exam; blood and imaging tests; a urine flow study; and examination with a scope called a cystoscope. Treatments include watchful waiting; medicines; nonsurgical procedures; and surgery.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Orthodontia,https://medlineplus.gov/orthodontia.html,Some people have naturally straight teeth that fit together. But if you have problems with your bite or the spacing of your teeth; you may need orthodontic care. Orthodontia is the branch of dentistry that deals with abnormalities of the teeth and jaw.Orthodontic care involves the use of devices; such as braces; toStraighten teethCorrect problems with biteClose gaps between teethAlign lips and teeth properly Most people who receive orthodontic care are kids; but adults get braces; too. In young children; orthodontic treatment may guide proper jaw growth. This can help permanent teeth to come in properly.  Straight permanent teeth can help prevent tooth problems later on.
Brachial Plexus Injuries,https://medlineplus.gov/brachialplexusinjuries.html,The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that sends signals from the spine to the shoulder; arm; and hand. Damage to the brachial plexus can cause symptoms such asA limp or paralyzed armLack of muscle control in the arm; hand; or wristLack of feeling or sensation in the arm or handBrachial plexus injuries can happen because of shoulder trauma; tumors; or inflammation. Sometimes they happen during childbirth when a baby's shoulders become stuck during delivery and the nerves stretch or tear.Some brachial plexus injuries may heal without treatment. Many children who are injured during birth improve or recover by 3 to 4 months of age. Treatment includes physical therapy and; in some cases; surgery.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Radiation Therapy,https://medlineplus.gov/radiationtherapy.html,Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment. It uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and stop them from spreading. About half of all cancer patients receive it. The radiation may be external; from special machines; or internal; from radioactive substances that a doctor places inside your body. The type of radiation therapy you receive depends on many factors; includingThe type of cancerThe size of the cancerThe cancer's location in the bodyHow close the cancer is to normal tissues that are sensitive to radiationHow far into the body the radiation needs to travelYour general health and medical historyWhether you will have other types of cancer treatmentOther factors; such as your age and other medical conditionsRadiation therapy can damage normal cells as well as cancer cells. Treatment must be carefully planned to minimize side effects. Common side effects include skin changes and fatigue. Other side effects depend on the part of your body being treated.Sometimes radiation is used with other treatments; like surgery or chemotherapy. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Arrhythmia,https://medlineplus.gov/arrhythmia.html,An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. It means that your heart beats too quickly; too slowly; or with an irregular pattern. When the heart beats faster than normal; it is called tachycardia. When the heart beats too slowly; it is called bradycardia. The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation; which causes an irregular and fast heart beat.Many factors can affect your heart's rhythm; such as having had a heart attack; smoking; congenital heart defects; and stress. Some substances or medicines may also cause arrhythmias. Symptoms of arrhythmias includeFast or slow heart beatSkipping beatsLightheadedness or dizzinessChest painShortness of breath Sweating Your doctor can run tests to find out if you have an arrhythmia. Treatment to restore a normal heart rhythm may include medicines; an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker; or sometimes surgery. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Brain Aneurysm,https://medlineplus.gov/brainaneurysm.html,A brain aneurysm is an abnormal bulge or "ballooning" in the wall of an artery in the brain. They are sometimes called berry aneurysms because they are often the size of a small berry. Most brain aneurysms produce no symptoms until they become large; begin to leak blood; or burst.If a brain aneurysm presses on nerves in your brain; it can cause signs and symptoms. These can includeA droopy eyelid Double vision or other changes in vision Pain above or behind the eye A dilated pupil Numbness or weakness on one side of the face or body Treatment depends on the size and location of the aneurysm; whether it is infected; and whether it has burst.

Stroke,https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html,A stroke is a medical emergency. Strokes happen when blood flow to your brain stops. Within minutes; brain cells begin to die.   There are two kinds of stroke. The more common kind; called ischemic stroke; is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. The other kind; called hemorrhagic stroke; is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain.   "Mini-strokes" or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs); occur when the blood supply to the brain is briefly interrupted.Symptoms of stroke are Sudden numbness or weakness of the face; arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)Sudden confusion; trouble speaking or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden trouble walking; dizziness; loss of balance or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeIf you have any of these symptoms; you must get to a hospital quickly to begin treatment. Acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot or by stopping the bleeding.  Post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage.  Drug therapy with blood thinners is the most common treatment for stroke.

Brain Tumors,https://medlineplus.gov/braintumors.html,A brain tumor is a growth of abnormal cells in the tissues of the brain. Brain tumors can be benign; with no cancer cells; or malignant; with cancer cells that grow quickly.  Some are primary brain tumors; which start in the brain. Others are metastatic; and they start somewhere else in the body and move to the brain.Brain tumors can cause many symptoms. Some of the most common areHeadaches; often in the morning Nausea and vomitingChanges in your ability to talk; hear; or seeProblems with balance or walkingProblems with thinking or memory Feeling weak or sleepyChanges in your mood or behaviorSeizuresDoctors diagnose brain tumors by doing a neurologic exam and tests including an MRI; CT scan; and biopsy. Treatment options include watchful waiting; surgery; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. Many people get a combination of treatments.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Concussion,https://medlineplus.gov/concussion.html,A concussion is a type of brain injury.  It involves a short loss of normal brain function. It happens when a hit to the head or body causes your head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. This sudden movement can cause the brain to bounce around or twist in the skull; creating chemical changes in your brain. Sometimes it can also stretch and damage your brain cells.Sometimes people call a concussion a "mild" brain injury. It is important to understand that while concussions may not be life-threatening; they can still be serious.Concussions are a common type of sports injury. Other causes of concussions include blows to the head; bumping your head when you fall; being violently shaken; and car accidents.Symptoms of a concussion may not start right away; they may start days or weeks after the injury. Symptoms may include a headache or neck pain. You may also have nausea; ringing in your ears; dizziness; or tiredness. You may feel dazed or not your normal self for several days or weeks after the injury. Consult your health care professional if any of your symptoms get worse; or if you have more serious symptoms such asConvulsions or seizuresDrowsiness or inability to wake upA headache that gets worse and does not go awayWeakness; numbness; or decreased coordinationRepeated vomiting or nauseaConfusionSlurred speechLoss of consciousnessTo diagnose a concussion; your health care provider will do a physical exam and will ask about your injury. You will most likely have a neurological exam; which checks your vision; balance; coordination; and reflexes. Your health care provider may also evaluate your memory and thinking. In some cases; you may also have a scan of the brain; such as a CT Scan or an MRI. A scan can check for bleeding or inflammation in the brain; as well as skull fractures.Most people recover fully after a concussion; but it can take some time. Rest is very important after a concussion because it helps the brain to heal. In the very beginning; you may need to limit physical activities or activities that involve a lot of concentration; such as studying; working on the computer; or playing video games. Doing these may cause concussion symptoms (such as headache or tiredness) to come back or get worse. Then when your health care provider says that it is ok; you can start to return to your normal activities slowly.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Brain Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/braindiseases.html,The brain is the control center of the body. It controls thoughts; memory; speech; and movement. It regulates the function of many organs. When the brain is healthy; it works quickly and automatically. However; when problems occur; the results can be devastating. Inflammation in the brain can lead to problems such as vision loss; weakness and paralysis. Loss of brain cells; which happens if you suffer a stroke; can affect your ability to think clearly. Brain tumors can also press on nerves and affect brain function. Some brain diseases are genetic. And we do not know what causes some brain diseases; such as Alzheimer's disease.The symptoms of brain diseases vary widely depending on the specific problem. In some cases; damage is permanent.  In other cases; treatments such as surgery; medicines; or physical therapy can correct the source of the problem or improve symptoms.
Genetic Brain Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/geneticbraindisorders.html,A genetic brain disorder is caused by a variation or a mutation in a gene.  A variation is a different form of a gene. A mutation is a change in a gene. Genetic brain disorders affect the development and function of the brain.Some genetic brain disorders are due to random gene mutations or mutations caused by environmental exposure; such as cigarette smoke. Other disorders are inherited; which means that a mutated gene or group of genes is passed down through a family. They can also be due to a combination of both genetic changes and other outside factors.Some examples of genetic brain disorders includeLeukodystrophiesPhenylketonuriaTay-Sachs diseaseWilson diseaseMany people with genetic brain disorders fail to produce enough of certain proteins that influence brain development and function. These brain disorders can cause serious problems that affect the nervous system. Some have treatments to control symptoms.  Some are life-threatening.
Hemorrhagic Stroke,https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhagicstroke.html,A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic stroke is the less common type. It happens when a blood vessel breaks and bleeds into the brain. Within minutes; brain cells begin to die. Causes include a bleeding aneurysm; an arteriovenous malformation (AVM); or an artery wall that breaks open.Symptoms of stroke areSudden numbness or weakness of the face; arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)Sudden confusion; trouble speaking or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden trouble walking; dizziness; loss of balance or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeIt is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. With a hemorrhagic stroke; the first steps are to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and then control it.  Surgery may be needed.  Post-stroke rehabilitation can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

Brain Malformations,https://medlineplus.gov/brainmalformations.html,Most brain malformations begin long before a baby is born. Something damages the developing nervous system or causes it to develop abnormally. Sometimes it's a genetic problem. In other cases; exposure to certain medicines; infections; or radiation during pregnancy interferes with brain development. Parts of the brain may be missing; abnormally small or large; or not fully developed.Treatment depends upon the problem. In many cases; treatment only helps with symptoms. It may include antiseizure medicines; shunts to drain fluid from the brain; and physical therapy.There are head malformations that do not involve the brain. Craniofacial disorders are the result of abnormal growth of soft tissue and bones in the face and head. It's common for new babies to have slightly uneven heads; but parents should watch the shape of their baby's head for possible problems.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

Dengue,https://medlineplus.gov/dengue.html,Dengue is an infection caused by a virus. You can get it if an infected mosquito bites you. Dengue does not spread from person to person. It is common in warm; wet areas of the world. Outbreaks occur in the rainy season. Dengue is rare in the United States. Symptoms include a high fever; headaches; joint and muscle pain; vomiting; and a rash. In some cases; dengue turns into dengue hemorrhagic fever; which causes bleeding from your nose; gums; or under your skin. It can also become dengue shock syndrome; which causes massive bleeding and shock. These forms of dengue are life-threatening.There is no specific treatment. Most people with dengue recover within 2 weeks. Until then; drinking lots of fluids; resting and taking non-aspirin fever-reducing medicines might help. People with the more severe forms of dengue usually need to go to the hospital and get fluids.To lower your risk when traveling to areas where dengue is foundWear insect repellent with DEET Wear clothes that cover your arms; legs and feet Close unscreened doors and windows  NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Breast Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/breastcancer.html,Breast cancer affects one in eight women during their lives. No one knows why some women get breast cancer; but there are many risk factors. Risks that you cannot change includeAge - the risk rises as you get olderGenes - two genes; BRCA1 and BRCA2; greatly increase the risk. Women who have family members with breast or ovarian cancer may wish to be tested for the genes.Personal factors - beginning periods before age 12 or going through menopause after age 55Other risks include obesity; using hormone replacement therapy (also called menopausal hormone therapy); taking birth control pills; drinking alcohol; not having children or having your first child after age 35; and having dense breasts.Symptoms of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast; a change in size or shape of the breast; and discharge from a nipple. Breast self-exams and mammography can help find breast cancer early; when it is most treatable. One possible treatment is surgery. It could be a lumpectomy or a mastectomy. Other treatments include radiation therapy; chemotherapy; hormone therapy; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.Men can have breast cancer; too; but it is rare.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Male Breast Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/malebreastcancer.html,Although breast cancer is much more common in women; men can get it too. It happens most often to men between the ages of 60 and 70.Breast lumps usually aren't cancer. However; most men with breast cancer have lumps. Other breast symptoms can includeDimpled or puckered skinA red; scaly nipple or skinFluid dischargeRisk factors for male breast cancer include exposure to radiation; a family history of breast cancer; and having high estrogen levels; which can happen with diseases like cirrhosis or Klinefelter's syndrome.Treatment for male breast cancer is usually a mastectomy; which is surgery to remove the breast. Other treatments include radiation; chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Breast Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/breastdiseases.html,Most women experience breast changes at some time. Your age; hormone levels; and medicines you take may cause lumps; bumps; and discharges (fluids that are not breast milk).If you have a breast lump; pain; discharge or skin irritation; see your health care provider. Minor and serious breast problems have similar  symptoms. Although many women fear cancer; most breast problems are not cancer.Some common breast changes areFibrocystic breast changes - lumpiness; thickening and swelling; often just before a woman's periodCysts - fluid-filled lumpsFibroadenomas - solid; round; rubbery lumps that move easily when pushed; occurring most in younger womenIntraductal papillomas - growths similar to warts near the nippleBlocked milk ductsMilk production when a woman is not breastfeedingNIH: National Cancer Institute
Breast Reconstruction,https://medlineplus.gov/breastreconstruction.html,If you need a mastectomy; you have a choice about whether or not to have surgery to rebuild the shape of the breast. Instead of breast reconstruction; you could choose to wear a breast form that replaces the breast; wear padding inside your bra; or do nothing. All of these options have pros and cons. What is right for one woman may not be right for another.Breast reconstruction may be done at the same time as the mastectomy; or it may be done later on. If radiation therapy is part of the treatment plan; your doctor may suggest waiting until after radiation therapy.If you're thinking about breast reconstruction; talk to a plastic surgeon before the mastectomy; even if you plan to have your reconstruction later on.A surgeon can reconstruct the breast in many ways. Some women choose to have breast implants; which are filled with saline or silicone gel. Another method uses tissue taken from another part of your body. The plastic surgeon can take skin; muscle; and fat from your lower abdomen; back; or buttocks.The type of reconstruction that is best for you depends on your age; body type; and the type of cancer surgery that you had. A plastic surgeon can help you decide.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/plasticandcosmeticsurgery.html,Surgeons can reshape the appearance of body parts through cosmetic surgery.  Some of the most common body parts people want to improve through surgery include   Breasts: Increase or reduce the size of breasts or reshape sagging breasts   Ears: Reduce the size of large ears or set protruding ears back closer to the head  Eyes: Correct drooping upper eyelids or remove puffy bags below the eyes  Face: Remove facial wrinkles; creases or acne scars  Hair: Fill in balding areas with one's own hair  Nose: Change the shape of the nose   Tummy:  Flatten the abdomen

Breastfeeding,https://medlineplus.gov/breastfeeding.html,Breastfeeding offers many benefits to your baby. Breast milk contains the right balance of nutrients to help your infant grow into a strong and healthy toddler. Some of the nutrients in breast milk also help protect your infant against some common childhood illnesses and infections. It may also help your health. Certain types of cancer may occur less often in mothers who have breastfed their babies.Women who don't have health problems should try to give their babies breast milk for at least the first six months of life. Most women with health problems can breastfeed. There are rare exceptions when women are advised not to breastfeed because they have certain illnesses.  Some medicines; illegal drugs; and alcohol can also pass through the breast milk and cause harm to your baby. Check with your health care provider if you have concerns about whether you should breastfeed.If you are having problems with breastfeeding; contact a lactation consultant.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Bad Breath,https://medlineplus.gov/badbreath.html,There are many reasons why you might have bad breath.  You can get it if you don't brush and floss regularly. Bacteria that build up in your mouth and between your teeth produce the bad odor. Other problems in your mouth; such as gum disease; dry mouth; or cavities; may also cause it. Sinusitis or problems with your nose may be to blame. You can also have bad breath if you eat some foods; like raw onions; garlic; or cabbage. And of course smoking causes its own bad smell. Some diseases and medicines can cause a specific breath odor.Having good dental habits; like brushing and flossing regularly; help fight bad breath. Mouthwashes; mints or chewing gum may make your breath fresher. If you have a disease that causes the bad breath; treating the disease may help give you fresher breath.
Breathing Problems,https://medlineplus.gov/breathingproblems.html,When you're short of breath; it's hard or uncomfortable for you to take in the oxygen your body needs. You may feel as if you're not getting enough air. Sometimes you can have mild breathing problems because of a stuffy nose or intense exercise. But shortness of breath can also be a sign of a serious disease.Many conditions can make you feel short of breath:Lung conditions such as asthma; emphysema; or pneumoniaProblems with your trachea or bronchi; which are part of your airway systemHeart disease can make you feel breathless if your heart cannot pump enough blood to supply oxygen to your bodyAnxiety and panic attacksAllergiesIf you often have trouble breathing; it is important to find out the cause.
Vital Signs,https://medlineplus.gov/vitalsigns.html,Your vital signs show how well your body is functioning. They are usually measured at doctor's offices; often as part of a health checkup; or during an emergency room visit. They includeBlood pressure; which measures the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Blood pressure that is too high or too low can cause problems. Your blood pressure has two numbers. The first number is the pressure when your heart beats and is pumping the blood.  The second is from when your heart is at rest; between beats. A normal blood pressure reading for adults is lower than 120/80 and higher than 90/60.Heart rate; or pulse; which measures how fast your heart is beating. A problem with your heart rate may be an arrhythmia. Your normal heart rate depends on factors such as your age; how much you exercise; whether you are sitting or standing; which medicines you take; and your weight.Respiratory rate; which measures your breathing. Mild breathing changes can be from causes such as a stuffy nose or hard exercise. But slow or fast breathing can also be a sign of a serious breathing problem.Temperature; which measures how hot your body is. A body temperature that is higher than normal (over 98.6 degrees F) is called a fever.
Fractures,https://medlineplus.gov/fractures.html,A fracture is a break; usually in a bone. If the broken bone punctures the skin; it is called an open or compound fracture. Fractures commonly happen because of car accidents; falls; or sports injuries.  Other causes are  low bone density and osteoporosis; which cause weakening of the bones. Overuse can cause stress fractures; which are very small cracks in the bone.  Symptoms of a fracture areIntense painDeformity - the limb looks out of placeSwelling; bruising; or tenderness around the injuryNumbness and tinglingProblems moving a limbYou need to get medical care right away for any fracture. An x-ray can tell if your bone is broken. You may need to wear a cast or splint. Sometimes you need surgery to put in plates; pins or screws to keep the bone in place.
Asthma,https://medlineplus.gov/asthma.html,Asthma is a chronic disease that affects your airways. Your airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma; the inside walls of your airways become sore and swollen. That makes them very sensitive; and they may react strongly to things that you are allergic to or find irritating. When your airways react; they get narrower and your lungs get less air.Symptoms of asthma includeWheezingCoughing; especially early in the morning or at nightChest tightnessShortness of breathNot all people who have asthma have these symptoms. Having these symptoms doesn't always mean that you have asthma. Your doctor will diagnose asthma based on lung function tests; your medical history; and a physical exam. You may also have allergy tests.When your asthma symptoms become worse than usual; it's called an asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care; and they can be fatal.Asthma is treated with two kinds of medicines: quick-relief medicines to stop asthma symptoms and long-term control medicines to prevent symptoms. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Bronchial Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/bronchialdisorders.html,When you breathe in; the air travels down through your trachea (windpipe). It then goes through two tubes to your lungs. These tubes are your bronchi. Bronchial disorders can make it hard for you to breathe.The most common problem with the bronchi is bronchitis; an inflammation of the tubes. It can be acute or chronic. Other problems includeBronchiectasis - a condition in which damage to the airways causes them to widen and become flabby and scarredExercise-induced bronchospasm - a breathing problem that happens when your airways shrink while you are exercisingBronchiolitis - an inflammation of the small airways that branch off from the bronchiBronchopulmonary dysplasia - a chronic lung condition in infants; most often premature infants

Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/respiratorysyncytialvirusinfections.html,Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes mild; cold-like symptoms in adults and older healthy children. It can cause serious problems in young babies; including pneumonia and severe breathing problems. Premature babies and those with other health problems have the highest risk. A child with RSV may have a fever; stuffy nose; cough; and trouble breathing. Lab tests can tell if your child has the virus. There is no specific treatment. You should give your child fluids to prevent dehydration. If needed; you can also give a pain reliever (not aspirin) for fever and headache.RSV easily spreads from person to person.  You can get it from direct contact with someone who has it or by touching infected objects such as toys or surfaces such as  countertops. Washing your hands often and not sharing eating and drinking utensils are simple ways to help prevent the spread of RSV infection. There is currently no vaccine for RSV.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Acute Bronchitis,https://medlineplus.gov/acutebronchitis.html,Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes; the airways that carry air to your lungs. It causes a cough that often brings up mucus. It can also cause shortness of breath; wheezing; a low fever; and chest tightness. There are two main types of bronchitis: acute and chronic.Most cases of acute bronchitis get better within several days. But your cough can last for several weeks after the infection is gone.The same viruses that cause colds and the flu often cause acute bronchitis. These viruses spread through the air when people cough; or though physical contact (for example; on unwashed hands). Being exposed to tobacco smoke; air pollution; dusts; vapors; and fumes can also cause acute bronchitis. Less often; bacteria can also cause acute bronchitis.To diagnose acute bronchitis; your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and listen to your breathing. You may also have other tests.Treatments include rest; fluids; and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. A humidifier or steam can also help. You may need inhaled medicine to open your airways if you are wheezing. Antibiotics won't help if the cause is viral. You may get antibiotics if the cause is bacterial.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Chronic Bronchitis,https://medlineplus.gov/chronicbronchitis.html,Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes; the airways that carry air to your lungs. It causes a cough that often brings up mucus. It can also cause shortness of breath; wheezing; a low fever; and chest tightness. There are two main types of bronchitis: acute and chronic. Chronic bronchitis is one type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The inflamed bronchial tubes produce a lot of mucus. This leads to coughing and difficulty breathing. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause. Breathing in air pollution; fumes; or dust over a long period of time may also cause it.To diagnose chronic bronchitis; your doctor will look at your signs and symptoms and listen to your breathing. You may also have other tests.Chronic bronchitis is a long-term condition that keeps coming back or never goes away completely. If you smoke; it is important to quit. Treatment can help with your symptoms. It often includes medicines to open your airways and help clear away mucus. You may also need oxygen therapy. Pulmonary rehabilitation may help you manage better in daily life.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Lung Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/lungcancer.html,Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. It is a leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States. Cigarette smoking causes most lung cancers. The more cigarettes you smoke per day and the earlier you started smoking; the greater your risk of lung cancer. High levels of pollution; radiation and asbestos exposure may also increase risk. Common symptoms of lung cancer includeA cough that doesn't go away and gets worse over timeConstant chest painCoughing up bloodShortness of breath; wheezing; or hoarsenessRepeated problems with pneumonia or bronchitisSwelling of the neck and faceLoss of appetite or weight lossFatigueDoctors diagnose lung cancer using a physical exam; imaging; and lab tests. Treatment depends on the type; stage; and how advanced it is. Treatments include surgery; chemotherapy; radiation therapy; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Pneumonia,https://medlineplus.gov/pneumonia.html,Pneumonia is an infection in one or both of the lungs. Many germs; such as bacteria; viruses; and fungi; can cause pneumonia.  You can also get pneumonia by inhaling a liquid or chemical. People most at risk are older than 65 or younger than 2 years of age; or already have health problems.Symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe. See your doctor promptly if youHave a high feverHave shaking chillsHave a cough with phlegm that doesn't improve or gets worseDevelop shortness of breath with normal daily activitiesHave chest pain when you breathe or coughFeel suddenly worse after a cold or the fluYour doctor will use your medical history; a physical exam; and lab tests to diagnose pneumonia. Treatment depends on what kind you have. If bacteria are the cause; antibiotics should help.  If you have viral pneumonia; your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat it.Preventing pneumonia is always better than treating it. Vaccines are available to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia and the flu. Other preventive measures include washing your hands frequently and not smoking.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Spider Bites,https://medlineplus.gov/spiderbites.html,Though many people are afraid of spiders; they rarely bite people unless threatened.  Most spider bites are harmless.  Occasionally; spider bites can cause allergic reactions. And bites by the venomous black widow and brown recluse spiders can be very dangerous to people. If you are bitten by a spider; you may see a reaction similar to that of a bee sting; including redness; pain and swelling at the site. To treat a spider bite:   Wash the area well with soap and water Apply an ice pack or a wet compress to the area Take over-the-counter pain medicine; if needed Consider using antihistamines for severe swelling Seek medical treatment for small children and adults with severe symptoms
Bruises,https://medlineplus.gov/bruises.html,A bruise is a mark on your skin caused by blood trapped under the surface. It happens when an injury crushes small blood vessels but does not break the skin. Those vessels break open and leak blood under the skin. Bruises are often painful and swollen. You can get skin; muscle and bone bruises. Bone bruises are the most serious.It can take months for a bruise to fade; but most last about two weeks. They start off a reddish color; and then turn bluish-purple and greenish-yellow before returning to normal. To reduce bruising; ice the injured area and elevate it above your heart. See your health care provider if you seem to bruise for no reason; or if the bruise appears to be infected.
Tooth Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/toothdisorders.html,Your teeth are made of a hard; bonelike material. Inside the tooth are nerves and blood vessels. You need your teeth for many activities you may take for granted. These include eating; speaking and even smiling. But tooth disorders are nothing to smile about.  They include problems such as cavities (also known as tooth decay); infections; and injuries.  The most familiar symptom of a tooth problem is a toothache. Others include worn-down or loose teeth. It's important that you see a dentist if you have any problems with your teeth. Fortunately; you can prevent many tooth disorders by taking care of your teeth and keeping them clean.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/creutzfeldtjakobdisease.html,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare; degenerative brain disorder. Symptoms usually start around age 60. Memory problems; behavior changes; vision problems; and poor muscle coordination progress quickly to dementia; coma; and death. Most patients die within a year.The three main categories of CJD are  Sporadic CJD; which occurs for no known reason Hereditary CJD; which runs in familiesAcquired CJD; which occurs from contact with infected tissue; usually during a medical procedureCattle can get a disease related to CJD called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow disease."  There is concern that people can get a variant of CJD from eating beef from an infected animal; but there is no direct proof to support this.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Plague,https://medlineplus.gov/plague.html,Plague is an infection caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The bacteria are found mainly in rats and in the fleas that feed on them. People and other animals can get plague from rat or flea bites. In the past; plague destroyed entire civilizations. Today plague is uncommon; due to better living conditions and antibiotics.There are three forms of plague:Bubonic plague causes the tonsils; adenoids; spleen; and thymus to become inflamed.  Symptoms include fever; aches; chills; and tender lymph glands.In septicemic plague; bacteria multiply in the blood. It causes fever; chills; shock; and bleeding under the skin or other organs.Pneumonic plague is the most serious form. Bacteria enter the lungs and cause pneumonia. People with the infection can spread this form to others. This type could be a bioterror agent.Lab tests can diagnose plague. Treatment is a strong antibiotic. There is no vaccine.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Eating Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eatingdisorders.html,Eating disorders are serious behavior problems. They can include severe overeating or not consuming enough food to stay healthy. They also involve extreme concern about your shape or weight.Types of eating disorders includeAnorexia nervosa; in which you become too thin; but you don't eat enough because you think you are fat Bulimia nervosa; which involves periods of overeating followed by purging; sometimes through self-induced vomiting or using laxativesBinge-eating; which is out-of-control eatingWomen are more likely than men to have eating disorders. They usually start in the teenage years and often occur along with depression; anxiety disorders; and substance abuse.Eating disorders can lead to heart and kidney problems and even death. Getting help early is important. Treatment involves monitoring; talk therapy; nutritional counseling; and sometimes medicines. NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
Pemphigus,https://medlineplus.gov/pemphigus.html,Pemphigus is an autoimmune disorder. If you have it; your immune system attacks healthy cells in your skin and mouth; causing blisters and sores. No one knows the cause. Pemphigus does not spread from person to person. It does not appear to be inherited. But some people's genes put them more at risk for pemphigus.Pemphigoid is also an autoimmune skin disease. It leads to deep blisters that do not break easily. Pemphigoid is most common in older adults and may be fatal for older; sick patients.Doctors diagnose pemphigus with a physical exam; a biopsy; and blood tests. The treatment of pemphigus and pemphigoid is the same: one or more medicines to control symptoms. These may includeSteroids; which reduce inflammationDrugs that suppress the immune system responseAntibiotics to treat associated infectionsNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Bullying,https://medlineplus.gov/bullying.html,Bullying is when a person or group repeatedly tries to harm someone who is weaker or who they think is weaker. Sometimes it involves direct attacks such as hitting; name calling; teasing or taunting. Sometimes it is indirect; such as spreading rumors or trying to make others reject someone.  Often people dismiss bullying among kids as a normal part of growing up. But bullying is harmful. It can lead children and teenagers to feel tense and afraid. It may lead them to avoid school. In severe cases; teens who are bullied may feel they need to take drastic measures or react violently. Others even consider suicide. For some; the effects of bullying last a lifetime.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Toe Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/toeinjuriesanddisorders.html,Fourteen of the 26 bones in your feet are in your toes. The toes; particularly your big toe; help you move and keep your balance.  Playing sports; running; stubbing your toe; and dropping something on your foot can damage your toes. Wearing shoes that are too loose or too tight can also cause toe problems. Certain diseases; such as severe arthritis; can cause toe problems and pain. Gout often causes pain in the big toe.Common toe problems include Corns and bunionsIngrown toenailsSprains and dislocationsFracturesTreatments for toe injuries and disorders vary. They might include shoe inserts or special shoes; padding; taping; medicines; rest; and in severe cases; surgery.
Burns,https://medlineplus.gov/burns.html,A burn is damage to your body's tissues caused by heat; chemicals; electricity; sunlight; or radiation. Scalds from hot liquids and steam; building fires and flammable liquids and gases are the most common causes of burns. Another kind is an inhalation injury; caused by breathing smoke.There are three types of burns:First-degree burns damage only the outer layer of skin Second-degree burns damage the outer layer and the layer underneathThird-degree burns damage or destroy the deepest layer of skin and tissues underneathBurns can cause swelling; blistering; scarring and; in serious cases; shock; and even death. They also can lead to infections because they damage your skin's protective barrier. Treatment for burns depends on the cause of the burn; how deep it is; and how much of the body it covers. Antibiotic creams can prevent or treat infections.  For more serious burns; treatment may be needed to clean the wound; replace the skin; and make sure the patient has enough fluids and nutrition.NIH: National Institute of General Medical Sciences
Gas,https://medlineplus.gov/gas.html,Everyone has gas. Most people pass gas 13 to 21 times a day. Passing gas through the mouth is called belching or burping.  Passing gas through the anus is called flatulence. Most of the time gas does not have an odor. The odor comes from bacteria in the large intestine that release small amounts of gases that contain sulfur.Gas in the digestive tract comes from two sources: air that you swallow and the breakdown of undigested food by bacteria in the large intestine.  Certain foods may cause gas.  Foods that produce gas in one person may not cause gas in another.You can reduce the amount of gas you have byDrinking lots of water and non-fizzy drinksEating more slowly so you swallow less air when you eatAvoiding milk products if you have lactose intoleranceMedicines can help reduce gas or the pain and bloating caused by gas. If your symptoms still bother you; see your health care provider.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Bursitis,https://medlineplus.gov/bursitis.html,A bursa is a small; fluid-filled sac that acts as a cushion between a bone and other moving parts; such as muscles; tendons; or skin. Bursitis occurs when a bursa becomes inflamed. People get bursitis by overusing a joint. It can also be caused by an injury. It usually occurs at the knee or elbow. Kneeling or leaning your elbows on a hard surface for a long time can make bursitis start. Doing the same kinds of movements every day or putting stress on joints increases your risk.Symptoms of bursitis include pain and swelling. Your doctor will diagnose bursitis with a physical exam and tests such as x-rays and MRIs. He or she may also take fluid from the swollen area to be sure the problem isn't an infection.Treatment of bursitis includes rest; pain medicines; or ice. If there is no improvement; your doctor may inject a drug into the area around the swollen bursa. If the joint still does not improve after 6 to 12 months; you may need surgery to repair damage and relieve pressure on the bursa.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/coronaryarterybypasssurgery.html,In coronary artery disease (CAD); the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to your heart muscle grow hardened and narrowed. You may try treatments such as lifestyle changes; medicines; and angioplasty; a procedure to open the arteries.  If these treatments don't help; you may need coronary artery bypass surgery.The surgery creates a new path for blood to flow to the heart.  The surgeon takes a healthy piece of vein from the leg or artery from the chest or wrist.  Then the surgeon attaches it to the coronary artery; just above and below the narrowed area or blockage. This allows blood to bypass (get around) the blockage. Sometimes people need more than one bypass.The results of the surgery usually are excellent. Many people remain symptom-free for many years. You may need surgery again if blockages form in the grafted arteries or veins or in arteries that weren't blocked before.  Lifestyle changes and medicines may help prevent arteries from becoming clogged again.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Cesarean Section,https://medlineplus.gov/cesareansection.html,A Cesarean section (C-section) is surgery to deliver a baby. The baby is taken out through the mother's abdomen. In the United States; almost one in three women has their babies this way. Some C-sections are planned; but many are done when unexpected problems happen during delivery. Reasons for a C-section may includeHealth problems in the motherThe mother carrying more than one babyThe size or position of the babyThe baby's health is in dangerLabor is not moving along as it shouldThe surgery is relatively safe for mother and baby. Still; it is major surgery and carries risks. It also takes longer to recover from a C-section than from vaginal birth. It can raise the risk of having difficulties with future pregnancies. Some women may have problems attempting a vaginal birth later. Still; many women are able to have a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC).NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Clostridium Difficile Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/clostridiumdifficileinfections.html,Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes diarrhea and more serious intestinal conditions such as colitis. Symptoms includeWatery diarrhea (at least three bowel movements per day for two or more days)FeverLoss of appetiteNauseaAbdominal pain or tendernessC. difficile is more common in people who need to take antibiotics for a long period of time.The elderly also have a higher risk of getting it.  The infection can spread in hospitals and nursing homes.Tests of your stool can diagnose C. difficile. Sometimes you might also need imaging tests; to check for complications.  Certain antibiotics can treat it. Rarely; there are severe cases that need surgery.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Coronary Artery Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/coronaryarterydisease.html,Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease. It is the leading cause of death in the United States in both men and women.CAD happens when the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material; called plaque; on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows; less blood can flow through the arteries. As a result; the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack.  Most heart attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the hearts' blood supply; causing permanent heart damage.  Over time; CAD can also weaken the heart muscle and contribute to heart failure and arrhythmias. Heart failure means the heart can't pump blood well to the rest of the body. Arrhythmias are changes in the normal beating rhythm of the heart.  NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Caffeine,https://medlineplus.gov/caffeine.html,What is caffeine?Caffeine is a bitter substance that occurs naturally in more than 60 plants includingCoffee beansTea leavesKola nuts; which are used to flavor soft drink colasCacao pods; which are used to make chocolate productsThere is also synthetic (man-made) caffeine; which is added to some medicines; foods; and drinks. For example; some pain relievers; cold medicines; and over-the-counter medicines for alertness contain synthetic caffeine. So do energy drinks and "energy-boosting" gums and snacks.Most people consume caffeine from drinks. The amounts of caffeine in different drinks can vary a lot; but it is generallyAn 8-ounce cup of coffee: 95-200 mgA 12-ounce can of cola: 35-45 mgAn 8-ounce energy drink: 70-100 mgAn 8-ounce cup of tea: 14-60 mgWhat are caffeine's effects on the body?Caffeine has many effects on your body's metabolism. ItStimulates your central nervous system; which can make you feel more awake and give you a boost of energyIs a diuretic; meaning that it helps your body get rid of extra salt and water by urinating moreIncreases the release of acid in your stomach; sometimes leading to an upset stomach or heartburnMay interfere with the absorption of calcium in the bodyIncreases your blood pressureWithin one hour of eating or drinking caffeine; it reaches its peak level in your blood. You may continue to feel the effects of caffeine for four to six hours.What are the side effects from too much caffeine?For most people; it is not harmful to consume up to 400mg of caffeine a day. If you do eat or drink too much caffeine; it can cause health problems; such asRestlessness and shakinessInsomniaHeadachesDizzinessRapid or abnormal heart rhythmDehydrationAnxietyDependency; so you need to take more of it to get the same resultsSome people are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others.What are energy drinks; and why can they be a problem?Energy drinks are beverages that have added caffeine. The amount of caffeine in energy drinks can vary widely; and sometimes the labels on the drinks do not give you the actual amount of caffeine in them. Energy drinks may also contain sugars; vitamins; herbs; and supplements.Companies that make energy drinks claim that the drinks can increase alertness and improve physical and mental performance. This has helped make the drinks popular with American teens and young adults. There's limited data showing that energy drinks might temporarily improve alertness and physical endurance. There is not enough evidence to show that they enhance strength or power. But what we do know is that energy drinks can be dangerous because they have large amounts of caffeine. And since they have lots of sugar; they can contribute to weight gain and worsen diabetes.Sometimes young people mix their energy drinks with alcohol. It is dangerous to combine alcohol and caffeine. Caffeine can interfere with your ability to recognize how drunk you are; which can lead you to drink more. This also makes you more likely to make bad decisions.Who should avoid or limit caffeine?You should check with your health care provider about whether you should limit or avoid caffeine if youAre pregnant; since caffeine passes through the placenta to your babyAre breastfeeding; since a small amount of caffeine that you consume is passed along to your babyHave sleep disorders; including insomniaHave migraines or other chronic headachesHave anxietyHave GERD or ulcersHave fast or irregular heart rhythmsHave high blood pressureTake certain medicines or supplements; including stimulants; certain antibiotics; asthma medicines; and heart medicines. Check with your health care provider about whether there might be interactions between caffeine and any medicines and supplements that you take.Are a child or teen. Neither should have as much caffeine as adults. Children can be especially sensitive to the effects of caffeine.What is caffeine withdrawal?If you have been consuming caffeine on a regular basis and then suddenly stop; you may have caffeine withdrawal. Symptoms can includeHeadachesDrowsinessIrritabilityNauseaDifficulty concentratingThese symptoms usually go away after a couple of days.
Calcium,https://medlineplus.gov/calcium.html,You have more calcium in your body than any other mineral. Calcium has many important jobs. The body stores more than 99 percent of its calcium in the bones and teeth to help make and keep them strong. The rest is throughout the body in blood; muscle and the fluid between cells. Your body needs calcium to help muscles and blood vessels contract and expand; to secrete hormones and enzymes and to send messages through the nervous system. It is important to get plenty of calcium in the foods you eat. Foods rich in calcium includeDairy products such as milk; cheese; and yogurtLeafy; green vegetablesFish with soft bones that you eat; such as canned sardines and salmonCalcium-enriched foods such as breakfast cereals; fruit juices; soy and rice drinks; and tofu. Check the product labels.The exact amount of calcium you need depends on your age and other factors. Growing children and teenagers need more calcium than young adults. Older women need plenty of calcium to prevent osteoporosis. People who do not eat enough high-calcium foods should take a calcium supplement.NIH: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements
Corns and Calluses,https://medlineplus.gov/cornsandcalluses.html,Corns and calluses are caused by pressure or friction on your skin. They often appear on feet where the bony parts of your feet rub against your shoes. Corns usually appear on the tops or sides of toes while calluses form on the soles of feet. Calluses also can appear on hands or other areas that are rubbed or pressed. Wearing shoes that fit better or using non-medicated pads may help. While bathing; gently rub the corn or callus with a washcloth or pumice stone to help reduce the size. To avoid infection; do not try to shave off the corn or callus. See your doctor; especially if you have diabetes or circulation problems. NIH: National Institute on Aging
Complementary and Integrative Medicine,https://medlineplus.gov/complementaryandintegrativemedicine.html,Many Americans use medical treatments that are not part of mainstream medicine. When you are using these types of care; it may be called complementary; integrative; or alternative medicine.Complementary medicine is used together with mainstream medical care. An example is using acupuncture to help with side effects of cancer treatment. When health care providers and facilities offer both types of care; it is called integrative medicine. Alternative medicine is used instead of mainstream medical care.The claims that non-mainstream practitioners make can sound promising. However; researchers do not know how safe many of these treatments are or how well they work. Studies are underway to determine the safety and usefulness of many of these practices.To minimize the health risks of a non-mainstream treatmentDiscuss it with your doctor. It might have side effects or interact with other medicines.Find out what the research says about itChoose practitioners carefullyTell all of your doctors and practitioners about all of the different types of treatments you useNIH: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health
Campylobacter Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/campylobacterinfections.html,Campylobacter infection is a common foodborne illness. You usually get it from eating contaminated food; especially raw or undercooked poultry. You can also get it from drinking contaminated water or raw milk; or handling infected animal feces (poop).Some infected people don't have any symptoms.  If you do have symptoms; they start two to five days after you are infected. They usually last about one week; and can includeDiarrhea (which could be bloody)CrampingAbdominal painFever FatigueNausea and vomitingHealth care providers use stool tests to make a diagnosis. Most people get better without treatment. You should drink extra fluids for as long as the diarrhea lasts. People who have a severe infection or a weakened immune system may need to take antibiotics. In rare cases; the infection can cause reactive arthritis or Guillain-Barre syndrome.To prevent Campylobacter infection; cook poultry thoroughly. Use a separate cutting board and utensils for meats. Make sure to clean them carefully with soap and hot water after you use them.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Leukodystrophies,https://medlineplus.gov/leukodystrophies.html,The leukodystrophies are rare diseases that affect the cells of the brain. Specifically; the diseases affect the myelin sheath; the material that surrounds and protects nerve cells. Damage to this sheath slows down or blocks messages between the brain and the rest of the body. This leads to problems with  Movement Speaking Vision Hearing  Mental and physical development   Most of the leukodystrophies are genetic. They usually appear during infancy or childhood. They can be hard to detect early because children seem healthy at first. However; symptoms gradually get worse over time.   There are no cures for any of the leukodystrophies. Medicines; speech therapy and physical therapy might help with symptoms. Researchers are testing bone marrow transplantation as a treatment for some of the leukodystrophies.  NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/cancer.html,Cancer begins in your cells; which are the building blocks of your body.   Normally; your body forms new cells as you need them; replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them; and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example; lung cancer starts in the lung; and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery; radiation and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy; immunotherapy or other types of biologic therapy; or stem cell transplantation. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Cancer Alternative Therapies,https://medlineplus.gov/canceralternativetherapies.html,You have many choices to make about your cancer treatment. One choice you might be thinking about is complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM is the term for medical products and practices that are not part of standard care.  Examples of CAM therapies are acupuncture; chiropractic; and herbal medicines.People with cancer may use CAM toHelp cope with the side effects of cancer treatmentsEase worries of cancer treatment and related stressFeel that they are doing something more to help their own careCAM treatments do not work for everyone. Some methods; such as acupuncture; might help with nausea; pain and other side effects of cancer treatment.  Talk to your doctor to make sure that all aspects of your cancer care work together.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Tumors and Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/tumorsandpregnancy.html,Tumors during pregnancy are rare; but they can happen. Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. The most common cancers in pregnancy are breast cancer; cervical cancer; lymphoma; and melanoma.  Cancer itself rarely harms the baby; and some cancer treatments are safe during pregnancy.  You and your health care provider will work together to find the best treatment.  Your options will depend on how far along the pregnancy is; as well as the type; size; and stage of your cancer.Another type of tumor that women can get is called a gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). It happens when a fertilized egg doesn't become a fetus.  GTD is not always easy to find.  It is usually benign; but some types can be malignant. The most common type of GTD is a molar pregnancy. In its early stages; it may look like a normal pregnancy. You should see your health care provider if you have vaginal bleeding (not menstrual bleeding). Treatment depends on the type of tumor; whether it has spread to other places; and your overall health.
Cancer Chemotherapy,https://medlineplus.gov/cancerchemotherapy.html,Normally; your cells grow and die in a controlled way. Cancer cells keep growing without control. Chemotherapy is drug therapy for cancer. It works by killing the cancer cells; stopping them from spreading; or slowing their growth.  However; it can also harm healthy cells; which causes side effects. You may have a lot of side effects; some; or none at all. It depends on the type and amount of chemotherapy you get and how your body reacts. Some common side effects are fatigue; nausea; vomiting; pain; and hair loss. There are ways to prevent or control some side effects. Talk with your health care provider about how to manage them.  Healthy cells usually recover after chemotherapy is over; so most side effects gradually go away.Your treatment plan will depend on the cancer type; the chemotherapy drugs used; the treatment goal; and how your body responds. Chemotherapy may be given alone or with other treatments. You may get treatment every day; every week; or every month. You may have breaks between treatments so that your body has a chance to build new healthy cells. You might take the drugs by mouth; in a shot; as a cream; or intravenously (by IV).NIH: National Cancer Institute
Cancer Immunotherapy,https://medlineplus.gov/cancerimmunotherapy.html,Immunotherapy is a cancer treatment that helps your immune system fight cancer. It is a type of biological therapy. Biological therapy uses substances that are made from living organisms; or versions of these substances that are made in a lab.Doctors don't yet use immunotherapy as often as other cancer treatments; such as surgery; chemotherapy; and radiation therapy. But they do use immunotherapy for some types of cancer; and researchers are doing clinical trials to see whether it also works for other types.When you have cancer; some of your cells begin to multiply without stopping. They spread into the surrounding tissues. One reason that the cancer cells can keep growing and spreading is that they are able to hide from your immune system. Some immunotherapies can "mark" your cancer cells. This makes it easier for your immune system to find and destroy the cells. It is a type of targeted therapy; a treatment that specifically targets cancer cells. Other types of immunotherapies work by boosting your immune system to work better against cancer.You could get immunotherapy intravenously (by IV); in pills or capsules; or in a cream for your skin. For bladder cancer; they might place it directly into your bladder. You may have treatment every day; week; or month. Some immunotherapies are given in cycles. It depends on your type of cancer; how advanced it is; the type of immunotherapy you get; and how well it is working.You may have side effects. The most common side effects are skin reactions at the needle site; if you get it by IV. Other side effects may include flu-like symptoms; or rarely; severe reactions.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Cancer in Children,https://medlineplus.gov/cancerinchildren.html,Cancer is a group related diseases. In all types of cancer; some of the body's cells begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues.Normally; new cells form as you need them; replacing old cells that die. Sometimes; this process goes wrong. New cells form when you don't need them; and old cells don't die when they should. The extra cells can form a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumorsaren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body.Children can get cancer in the same parts of the body as adults; but there are differences. Childhood cancers can occur suddenly; without early symptoms; and have a high rate of cure. The most common children's cancer is leukemia. Other cancers that affect children include brain tumors; lymphoma; and soft tissue sarcoma.Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Treatments include surgery; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; stem cell transplants; and/or targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Benign Tumors,https://medlineplus.gov/benigntumors.html,Tumors are abnormal growths in your body. They can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. Benign tumors grow only in one place. They cannot spread or invade other parts of your body. Even so; they can be dangerous if they press on vital organs; such as your brain.Tumors are made up of extra cells. Normally; cells grow and divide to form new cells as your body needs them. When cells grow old; they die; and new cells take their place. Sometimes; this process goes wrong. New cells form when your body does not need them; and old cells do not die when they should. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form tumor.Treatment often involves surgery. Benign tumors usually don't grow back.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Cancer--Living with Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/cancerlivingwithcancer.html,Cancer is common. Half of all men and a third of women will get a diagnosis of cancer in their lifetime. Many people with cancer do survive. Millions of Americans alive today have a history of cancer.For most people with cancer; living with the disease is the biggest challenge they have ever faced. It can change your routines; roles and relationships. It can cause money and work problems. The treatment can change the way you feel and look. Learning more about ways you can help yourself may ease some of your concerns.  Support from others is important.All cancer survivors should have follow-up care. Knowing what to expect after cancer treatment can help you and your family make plans; lifestyle changes; and important decisions.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Yeast Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/yeastinfections.html,Candida is the scientific name for yeast. It is a fungus that lives almost everywhere; including in your body. Usually; your immune system keeps yeast under control. If you are sick or taking antibiotics; it can multiply and cause an infection. Yeast infections affect different parts of the body in different ways: Thrush is a yeast infection that causes white patches in your mouth Candida esophagitis is thrush that spreads to your esophagus; the tube that takes food from your mouth to your stomach. It can make it hard or painful to swallow. Women can get vaginal yeast infections; causing vaginitisYeast infections of the skin cause itching and rashes Yeast infections in your bloodstream can be life-threatening Antifungal medicines get rid of yeast infections in most people. If you have a weak immune system; treatment might be more difficult.
Mobility Aids,https://medlineplus.gov/mobilityaids.html,Mobility aids help you walk or move from place to place if you are disabled or have an injury. They includeCrutchesCanesWalkersWheelchairsMotorized scootersYou may need a walker or cane if you are at risk of falling. If you need to keep your body weight off your foot; ankle or knee; you may need crutches. You may need a wheelchair or a scooter if an injury or disease has left you unable to walk. Choosing these devices takes time and research. You should be fitted for crutches; canes and walkers. If they fit; these devices give you support; but if they don't fit; they can be uncomfortable and unsafe.
Canker Sores,https://medlineplus.gov/cankersores.html,Canker sores are small; round sores in your mouth. They can be on the inside of your cheek; under your tongue; or in the back of your throat. They usually have a red edge and a gray center. They can be quite painful. They are not the same as cold sores; which are caused by herpes simplex.Canker sores aren't contagious. They may happen if you have a viral infection. They may also be triggered by stress; food allergies; lack of vitamins and minerals; hormonal changes or menstrual periods. In some cases the cause is unknown.In most cases; the sores go away by themselves. Some ointments; creams or rinses may help with the pain. Avoiding hot; spicy food while you have a canker sore also helps.
Marijuana,https://medlineplus.gov/marijuana.html,Marijuana is a green; brown; or gray mix of dried; crumbled parts from the marijuana plant. It can be rolled up and smoked like a cigarette or cigar or smoked in a pipe. Sometimes people mix it in food or inhale it using a vaporizer.Marijuana can cause problems with memory; learning; and behavior. Smoking it can cause some of the same coughing and breathing problems as smoking cigarettes. Some people get addicted to marijuana after using it for a while. It is more likely to happen if they use marijuana every day; or started using it when they were teenagers.Some states have approved "medical marijuana" to ease symptoms of various health problems. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the marijuana plant as a medicine.  However; there have been scientific studies of cannabinoids; the chemicals in marijuana. This has led to two FDA-approved medicines. They contain THC; the active ingredient in marijuana. They treat nausea caused by chemotherapy and increase appetite in patients who have severe weight loss from HIV/AIDS. Scientists are doing more research with marijuana and its ingredients to treat many diseases and conditions.NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Motor Vehicle Safety,https://medlineplus.gov/motorvehiclesafety.html,Every year thousands of people in the U.S. die from motor vehicle crashes. Trying to prevent these crashes is one part of motor vehicle safety.  Here are some things you can do to be safer on the road: Make sure your vehicle is safe and in working order Use car seats for children Wear your seat belt Don't speed or drive aggressively Don't drive impairedSafety also involves being aware of others. Share the road with bicycles and motorcycles; and watch for pedestrians.

Carbohydrate Metabolism Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/carbohydratemetabolismdisorders.html,Metabolism is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Food is made up of proteins; carbohydrates; and fats. Chemicals in your digestive system (enzymes) break the food parts down into sugars and acids; your body's fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away; or it can store the energy in your body tissues. If you have a metabolic disorder; something goes wrong with this process.Carbohydrate metabolism disorders are a group of metabolic disorders. Normally your enzymes break carbohydrates down into glucose (a type of sugar). If you have one of these disorders; you may not have enough enzymes to break down the carbohydrates. Or the enzymes may not work properly. This causes a harmful amount of sugar to build up in your body. That can lead to health problems; some of which can be serious. Some of the disorders are fatal.These disorders are inherited. Newborn babies get screened for many of them; using blood tests. If there is a family history of one of these disorders; parents can get genetic testing to see whether they carry the gene. Other genetic tests can tell whether the fetus has the disorder or carries the gene for the disorder.Treatments may include special diets; supplements; and medicines. Some babies may also need additional treatments; if there are complications. For some disorders; there is no cure; but treatments may help with symptoms.
Carbohydrates,https://medlineplus.gov/carbohydrates.html,Carbohydrates are one of the main types of nutrients.  They are the most important source of energy for your body. Your digestive system changes carbohydrates into glucose (blood sugar). Your body  uses this sugar for energy for your cells; tissues and organs. It stores any extra sugar in your liver and muscles for when it is needed.Carbohydrates are called simple or complex; depending on their chemical structure. Simple carbohydrates include sugars found naturally in foods such as fruits; vegetables; milk; and milk products. They also include sugars added during food processing and refining. Complex carbohydrates include whole grain breads and cereals; starchy vegetables and legumes. Many of the complex carbohydrates are good sources of fiber.For a healthy diet; limit the amount of added sugar that you eat and choose whole grains over refined grains.
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning,https://medlineplus.gov/carbonmonoxidepoisoning.html,Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that has no odor or color. But it is very dangerous. It can cause sudden illness and death. CO is found in combustion fumes; such as those made by cars and trucks; lanterns; stoves; gas ranges and heating systems. CO from these fumes can build up in places that don't have a good flow of fresh air.  You can be poisoned by breathing them in.  The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are  Headache Dizziness Weakness Nausea Vomiting Chest pain Confusion  It is often hard to tell if someone has CO poisoning; because the symptoms may be like those of other illnesses. People who are sleeping or intoxicated can die from CO poisoning before they have symptoms. A CO detector can warn you if you have high levels of CO in your home.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Carcinoid Tumors,https://medlineplus.gov/carcinoidtumors.html,Carcinoid tumors are rare; slow-growing cancers. They usually start in the lining of the digestive tract or in the lungs. They grow slowly and don't produce symptoms in the early stages. As a result; the average age of people diagnosed with digestive or lung carcinoids is about 60.  In later stages the tumors sometimes produce hormones that can cause carcinoid syndrome. The syndrome causes flushing of the face and upper chest; diarrhea; and trouble breathing. Surgery is the main treatment for carcinoid tumors. If they haven't spread to other parts of the body; surgery can cure the cancer.
Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/cancer.html,Cancer begins in your cells; which are the building blocks of your body.   Normally; your body forms new cells as you need them; replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them; and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example; lung cancer starts in the lung; and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery; radiation and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy; immunotherapy or other types of biologic therapy; or stem cell transplantation. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Cardiac Arrest,https://medlineplus.gov/cardiacarrest.html,The heart has an internal electrical system that controls the rhythm of the heartbeat. Problems can cause abnormal heart rhythms; called arrhythmias. There are many types of arrhythmia. During an arrhythmia; the heart can beat too fast; too slow; or it can stop beating. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurs when the heart develops an arrhythmia that causes it to stop beating. This is different than a heart attack; where the heart usually continues to beat but blood flow to the heart is blocked. There are many possible causes of SCA. They include coronary heart disease; physical stress; and some inherited disorders. Sometimes there is no known cause for the SCA.Without medical attention; the person will die within a few minutes. People are less likely to die if they have early defibrillation. Defibrillation sends an electric shock to restore the heart rhythm to normal. You should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to a person having SCA until defibrillation can be done.If you have had an SCA; an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) reduces the chance of dying from a second SCA.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Heart Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/heartdiseases.html,If you're like most people; you think that heart disease is a problem for others. But heart disease is the number one killer in the U.S. It is also a major cause of disability. There are many different forms of heart disease. The most common cause of heart disease is narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries; the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart itself. This is called coronary artery disease and happens slowly over time. It's the major reason people have heart attacks. Other kinds of heart problems may happen to the valves in the heart; or the heart may not pump well and cause heart failure. Some people are born with heart disease.You can help reduce your risk of heart disease by taking steps to control factors that put you at greater risk: Control your blood pressure Lower your cholesterol Don't smoke Get enough exerciseNIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Heart Failure,https://medlineplus.gov/heartfailure.html,Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Heart failure does not mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. It means that your heart is not able to pump blood the way it should. It can affect one or both sides of the heart.The weakening of the heart's pumping ability causesBlood and fluid to back up into the lungsThe buildup of fluid in the feet; ankles and legs - called edemaTiredness and shortness of breathCommon causes of heart failure are coronary artery disease; high blood pressure and diabetes. It is more common in people who are 65 years old or older; African Americans; people who are overweight; and people who have had a heart attack. Men have a higher rate of heart failure than women.Your doctor will diagnose heart failure by doing a physical exam and heart tests. Treatment includes treating the underlying cause of your heart failure; medicines; and heart transplantation if other treatments fail.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Cardiac Rehabilitation,https://medlineplus.gov/cardiacrehabilitation.html,Cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) is a medically supervised program to help people who haveA heart attackAngioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting for coronary heart diseaseA heart valve repair or replacementA heart transplant or a lung transplantAnginaHeart failureThe goal is to help you return to an active life; and to reduce the risk of further heart problems.  A team of specialists will create a plan for you that includes exercise training; education on heart healthy living; and counseling to reduce stress.  You will learn how to reduce your risk factors; such as high blood pressure; high blood cholesterol; depression; and diabetes. Being overweight; having obesity; smoking; and not exercising are other risk factors. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Heart Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/heartsurgery.html,Heart surgery can correct problems with the heart if other treatments haven't worked or can't be used. The most common type of heart surgery for adults is coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). During CABG; a healthy artery or vein from the body is connected; or grafted; to a blocked coronary (heart) artery.Doctors also use heart surgery toRepair or replace heart valves; which control blood flow through the heartRepair abnormal or damaged structures in the heartImplant medical devices that help control the heartbeat or support heart function and blood flowReplace a damaged heart with a healthy heart from a donorTreat heart failure and coronary heart disease Control abnormal heart rhythmsHeart surgery has risks; even though its results often are excellent. Risks include bleeding; infection; irregular heartbeats; and stroke. The risk is higher if you are older or a woman. The risk is also higher if you have other diseases or conditions; such as diabetes; kidney disease; lung disease; or peripheral arterial disease.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Heart Health Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/hearthealthtests.html,Heart diseases are the number one killer in the U.S. They are also a major cause of disability. If you do have a heart disease; it is important to find it early; when it is easier to treat. Blood tests and heart health tests can help find heart diseases or identify problems that can lead to heart diseases. There are several different types of heart health tests. Your doctor will decide which test or tests you need; based on your symptoms (if any); risk factors; and medical history.Cardiac CatheterizationCardiac catheterization is a medical procedure used to diagnose and treat some heart conditions. For the procedure; your doctor puts a catheter (a long; thin; flexible tube) into a blood vessel in your arm; groin; or neck; and threads it to your heart. The doctor can use the catheter toDo a coronary angiography. This involves putting a special type of dye in the catheter; so the dye can flow through your bloodstream to your heart. Then your doctor takes x-rays of your heart. The dye allows your doctor to see your coronary arteries on the x-ray; and to check for coronary artery disease (plaque buildup in the arteries).Take samples of blood and heart muscleDo procedures such as minor heart surgery or angioplasty; if your doctor finds that you need itCardiac CT ScanA cardiac CT (computed tomography) scan is a painless imaging test that uses x-rays to take detailed pictures of your heart and its blood vessels. Computers can combine these pictures to create a three-dimensional (3D) model of the whole heart. This test can help doctors detect or evaluateCoronary artery diseaseCalcium buildup in the coronary arteriesProblems with the aortaProblems with heart function and valvesPericardial diseasesBefore you have the test; you get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures. The CT scanner is a large; tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table which slides you into the scanner; and the scanner takes the pictures for about 15 minutes.Cardiac MRICardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a painless imaging test that uses radio waves; magnets; and a computer to create detailed pictures of your heart. It can help your doctor figure out whether you have heart disease; and if so; how severe it is. A cardiac MRI can also help your doctor decide the best way to treat heart problems such asCoronary artery diseaseHeart valve problemsPericarditisCardiac tumorsDamage from a heart attackThe MRI is a large; tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table which slides you into the MRI machine. The machine makes loud noises as it takes pictures of your heart. It usually takes about 30-90 minutes. Sometimes before the test; you might get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures.Chest X-RayA chest x-ray creates pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest; such as your heart; lungs; and blood vessels. It can reveal signs of heart failure; as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to heart disease.Coronary AngiographyCoronary angiography (angiogram) is a procedure that uses contrast dye and x-ray pictures to look at the insides of your arteries. It can show whether plaque is blocking your arteries and how severe the blockage is. Doctors use this procedure to diagnose heart diseases after chest pain; sudden cardiac arrest; or abnormal results from other heart tests such as an EKG or a stress test.You usually have a cardiac catheterization to get the dye into your coronary arteries. Then you have special x-rays while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels.EchocardiographyEchocardiography; or echo; is a painless test that uses sound waves to create moving pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart. They also show how well your heart's chambers and valves are working. Doctors use an echo to diagnose many different heart problems; and to check how severe they are.For the test; a technician applies gel to your chest. The gel helps sound waves reach your heart. The technician moves a transducer (wand-like device) around on your chest. The transducer connects to a computer. It transmits ultrasound waves into your chest; and the waves bounce (echo) back. The computer converts the echoes into pictures of your heart.Electrocardiogram (EKG); (ECG)An electrocardiogram; also called an ECG or EKG; is a painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. It shows how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is steady or irregular.An EKG may be part of a routine exam to screen for heart disease. Or you may get it to detect and study heart problems such as heart attacks; arrhythmia; and heart failure.For the test; you lie still on a table and a nurse or technician attaches electrodes (patches that have sensors) to the skin on your chest; arms; and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a machine that records your heart's electrical activity.Stress TestingStress testing looks at how your heart works during physical stress. It can help to diagnose coronary artery disease; and to check how severe it is. It can also check for other problems; including heart valve disease and heart failure.For the test; you exercise (or are given medicine if you are unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast. While this is happening; you get an EKG and blood pressure monitoring. Sometimes you may also have an echocardiogram; or other imaging tests such as a nuclear scan. For the nuclear scan; you get an injection of a tracer (a radioactive substance); which travels to your heart. Special cameras detect the energy from the tracer to make pictures of your heart. You have pictures taken after you exercise; and then after you rest.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Cardiomyopathy,https://medlineplus.gov/cardiomyopathy.html,Cardiomyopathy is the name for diseases of the heart muscle. These diseases enlarge your heart muscle or make it thicker and more rigid than normal. In rare cases; scar tissue replaces the muscle tissue.Some people live long; healthy lives with cardiomyopathy. Some people don't even realize they have it. In others; however; it can make the heart less able to pump blood through the body. This can cause serious complications; including Heart failure  Abnormal heart rhythms  Heart valve problems Sudden cardiac arrestHeart attacks; high blood pressure; infections; and other diseases can all cause cardiomyopathy. Some types of cardiomyopathy run in families. In many people; however; the cause is unknown. Treatment might involve medicines; surgery; other medical procedures; and lifestyle changes. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
CPR,https://medlineplus.gov/cpr.html,When someone's blood flow or breathing stops; seconds count. Permanent brain damage or death can happen quickly. If you know how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); you could save a life. CPR is an emergency procedure for a person whose heart has stopped or is no longer breathing.  CPR can maintain circulation and breathing until emergency medical help  arrives.Even if you haven't had training; you can do "hands-only" CPR for a teen or adult whose heart has stopped beating ("hands-only" CPR isn't recommended for children).  "Hands-only" CPR uses chest compressions to keep blood circulating until emergency help arrives. If you've had training; you can use chest compressions; clear the airway; and do rescue breathing. Rescue breathing helps get oxygen to the lungs for a person who has stopped breathing.  To keep your skills up; you should repeat the training every two years.
Esophagus Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/esophagusdisorders.html,The esophagus is the muscular tube that carries food; and liquids from your mouth to the stomach. You may not be aware of your esophagus until you swallow something too large; too hot; or too cold. You may also notice it when something is wrong. You may feel pain or have trouble swallowing.The most common problem with the esophagus is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). With GERD; a muscle at the end of your esophagus does not close properly. This allows stomach contents to leak back; or reflux; into the esophagus and irritate it. Over time; GERD can cause damage to the esophagus.Other problems include heartburn; cancer; and esophagitis. Doctors may use various tests to make a diagnosis. These include imaging tests; an upper endoscopy; and a biopsy.Treatment depends on the problem. Some problems get better with over-the-counter medicines or changes in diet. Others may need prescription medicines or surgery.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Vascular Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/vasculardiseases.html,The vascular system is the body's network of blood vessels. It includes the arteries; veins and capillaries that carry blood to and from the heart. Problems of the vascular system are common and can be serious. Arteries can become thick and stiff; a problem called atherosclerosis. Blood clots can clog vessels and block blood flow to the heart or brain. Weakened blood vessels can burst; causing bleeding inside the body. You are more likely to have vascular disease as you get older. Other factors that make vascular disease more likely include Family history of vascular or heart diseases Pregnancy Illness or injury  Long periods of sitting or standing still Any condition that affects the heart and blood vessels; such as diabetes or high cholesterol  Smoking  Obesity Losing weight; eating healthy foods; being active and not smoking can help vascular disease. Other treatments include medicines and surgery.
Health Occupations,https://medlineplus.gov/healthoccupations.html,Every day; around the clock; people who work in the health care industry provide care for millions of people; from newborns to the very ill. In fact; the health care industry is one of largest providers of jobs in the United States. Many health jobs are in hospitals. Others are in nursing homes; doctors' offices; dentists' offices; outpatient clinics and laboratories.To work in a health occupation; you often must have special training.  Some; like doctors; must have more than 4 years of college.Bureau of Labor Statistics
Caregivers,https://medlineplus.gov/caregivers.html,Caregivers provide help to another person in need. The person receiving care may be an adult - often a parent or a spouse - or a child with special medical needs. Some caregivers are family members. Others are paid. They do many things:Shop for food and cookClean the housePay billsGive medicineHelp the person go  to the toilet; bathe and dressHelp the person eatProvide company and emotional supportCaregiving is hard; and caregivers of chronically ill people often feel stress. They are "on call" 24 hours a day; 7 days a week.  If you're caring for someone with mental problems like Alzheimer's disease  it can be especially difficult. Support groups can help.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Alzheimer's Caregivers,https://medlineplus.gov/alzheimerscaregivers.html,Caring for someone who has Alzheimer's disease  (AD) can be stressful and overwhelming. It's important to take care of yourself. Ask for and accept help. Talk to the doctor. Find out what treatments might help control symptoms or address behavior problems. Find a support group. Others who have "been there" may be able to help and will understand.  If there are times of day that the person is less confused or more cooperative; take advantage of that in daily routines. Consider using adult day care or respite services. These offer a break with the peace of mind that the patient is being taken care of.  Begin to plan for the future. This may include   Getting financial and legal documents in order  Looking into assisted living or nursing homes Finding out what your health insurance and Medicare will cover  NIH: National Institute on Aging
Carotid Artery Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/carotidarterydisease.html,Your carotid arteries are two large blood vessels in your neck. They supply your brain and head with blood.  If you have carotid artery disease; the arteries become narrow or blocked; usually because of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaque; which is made up of fat; cholesterol; calcium; and other substances found in the blood.Carotid artery disease is serious because it can block the blood flow to your brain; causing a stroke. Too much plaque in the artery can cause a blockage. You can also have a blockage when a piece of plaque or a blood clot breaks off the wall of an artery. The plaque or clot can travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in one of your brain's smaller arteries.Carotid artery disease often does not cause symptoms until the blockage or narrowing is severe.  One sign may be a bruit (whooshing sound) that your doctor hears when listening to your artery with a stethoscope. Another sign is a transient ischemic attack (TIA); a "mini-stroke." A TIA is like a stroke; but it only lasts a few minutes; and the symptoms usually go away within an hour. Stroke is another sign.Imaging tests can confirm whether you have carotid artery disease.Treatments may includeHealthy lifestyle changesMedicinesCarotid endarterectomy; surgery to remove the plaqueAngioplasty; a procedure to place a balloon and stent into the artery to open it and hold it openNIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

Ischemic Stroke,https://medlineplus.gov/ischemicstroke.html,A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is the most common type. It is usually caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This keeps blood from flowing to the brain. Within minutes; brain cells begin to die.  Another cause is stenosis; or narrowing of the artery. This can happen because of atherosclerosis; a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke.Symptoms of stroke areSudden numbness or weakness of the face; arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)Sudden confusion; trouble speaking or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden trouble walking; dizziness; loss of balance or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeIt is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. Blood thinners may be used to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot. Post-stroke rehabilitation can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/carpaltunnelsyndrome.html,You're working at your desk; trying to ignore the tingling or numbness you've had for some time in your hand and wrist. Suddenly; a sharp; piercing pain shoots through the wrist and up your arm. Just a passing cramp? It could be carpal tunnel syndrome.The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway of ligament and bones at the base of your hand. It contains nerve and tendons. Sometimes; thickening from irritated tendons or other swelling narrows the tunnel and causes the nerve to be compressed. Symptoms usually start gradually. As they worsen; grasping objects can become difficult.Often; the cause is having a smaller carpal tunnel than other people do. Other causes include performing assembly line work; wrist injury; or swelling due to certain diseases; such as rheumatoid arthritis. Women are three times more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome than men.Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent permanent nerve damage. Your doctor diagnoses carpal tunnel syndrome with a physical exam and special nerve tests.  Treatment includes resting your hand; splints; pain and anti-inflammatory medicines; and sometimes surgery. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Motion Sickness,https://medlineplus.gov/motionsickness.html,Motion sickness is a common problem in people traveling by car; train; airplanes; and especially boats. Anyone can get it; but it is more common in children; pregnant women; and people taking certain medicines. Motion sickness can start suddenly; with a queasy feeling and cold sweats. It can then lead to dizziness and nausea and vomiting.Your brain senses movement by getting signals from your inner ears; eyes; muscles; and joints. When it gets signals that do not match; you can get motion sickness. For example; if you are reading on your phone while riding a bus; your eyes are focused on something that is not moving; but your inner ear senses motion.Where you sit can make a difference. The front seat of a car; forward cars of a train; upper deck on a boat or wing seats in a plane may give you a smoother ride. Looking out into the distance - instead of trying to read or look at something in the vehicle - can also help. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Cartilage Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/cartilagedisorders.html,Cartilage is the tough but flexible tissue that covers the ends of your bones at a joint. It also gives shape and support to other parts of your body; such as your ears; nose and windpipe. Healthy cartilage helps you move by allowing your bones to glide over each other. It also protects bones by preventing them from rubbing against each other. Injured; inflamed; or damaged cartilage can cause symptoms such as pain and limited movement. It can also lead to joint damage and deformity. Causes of cartilage problems include Tears and injuries; such as sports injuriesGenetic factors Other disorders; such as some types of arthritisOsteoarthritis results from breakdown of cartilage.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Animal Bites,https://medlineplus.gov/animalbites.html,Wild animals usually avoid people. They might attack; however; if they feel threatened; are sick; or are protecting their young or territory. Attacks by pets are more common. Animal bites rarely are life-threatening; but if they become infected; you can develop serious medical problems. To prevent animal bites and complications from bitesNever pet; handle; or feed unknown animals Leave snakes aloneWatch your children closely around animalsVaccinate your cats; ferrets; and dogs against rabiesSpay or neuter your dog to make it less aggressiveGet a tetanus booster if you have not had one recentlyWear boots and long pants when you are in areas with venomous snakesIf an animal bites you; clean the wound with soap and water as soon as possible. Get medical attention if necessary.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
CT Scans,https://medlineplus.gov/ctscans.html,Computed tomography (CT) is a type of imaging. It uses special x-ray equipment to make cross-sectional pictures of your body. Doctors use CT scans to look for Broken bones Cancers Blood clots Signs of heart disease Internal bleedingDuring a CT scan; you lie still on a table. The table slowly passes through the center of a large X-ray machine. The test is painless. During some tests you receive a contrast dye; which makes parts of your body show up better in the image.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Cat Scratch Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/catscratchdisease.html,Cat scratch disease (CSD) is an illness caused by the bacterium Bartonella henselae. Almost half of all cats carry the infection at some point. The infection does not make cats sick. However; the scratch or bite of an infected cat can cause symptoms in people; including Swollen lymph nodes; especially around the head; neck; and upper limbsFever HeadacheFatiguePoor appetite For people with weak immune systems; CSD may cause more serious problems. The best way to avoid CSD is to avoid rough play with cats that could lead to scratches or bites. If you do get a scratch or bite; wash it well with soap and water. If the bite or scratch gets infected or if you have symptoms of CSD; call your doctor. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Cataract,https://medlineplus.gov/cataract.html,A cataract is a clouding of the lens in your eye.  It affects your vision.  Cataracts are very common in older people. By age 80; more than half of all Americans either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery.A cataract can occur in either or both eyes. It cannot spread from one eye to the other. Common symptoms areBlurry visionColors that seem fadedGlare - headlights; lamps or sunlight may seem too bright. You may also see a halo around lights.Not being able to see well at nightDouble vision Frequent prescription changes in your eye wear Cataracts usually develop slowly. New glasses; brighter lighting; anti-glare sunglasses or magnifying lenses can help at first. Surgery is also an option. It involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. Wearing sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block ultraviolet sunlight may help to delay cataracts.NIH: National Eye Institute
Complex Regional Pain Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/complexregionalpainsyndrome.html,Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition. It causes intense pain; usually in the arms; hands; legs; or feet. It may happen after an injury; either to a nerve or to tissue in the affected area. Rest and time may only make it worse.Symptoms in the affected area areDramatic changes in skin temperature; color; or textureIntense burning painExtreme skin sensitivitySwelling and stiffness in affected jointsDecreased ability to move the affected body partThe cause of CRPS is unknown. There is no specific diagnostic test. Your doctor will diagnose CRPS based on your signs and symptoms.There is no cure. It can get worse over time; and may spread to other parts of the body. Occasionally it goes away; either temporarily or for good. Treatment focuses on relieving the pain; and can include medicines; physical therapy; and nerve blocks.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Tooth Decay,https://medlineplus.gov/toothdecay.html,You call it a cavity. Your dentist calls it tooth decay or dental caries.  They're all names for a hole in your tooth. The cause of tooth decay is plaque; a sticky substance in your mouth made up mostly of germs. Tooth decay starts in the outer layer; called the enamel. Without a filling; the decay can get deep into the tooth and its nerves and cause a toothache or abscess. To help prevent cavities  Brush your teeth every day with a fluoride toothpaste Clean between your teeth every day with floss or another type of between-the-teeth cleaner Snack smart - limit sugary snacks See your dentist or oral health professional regularly
Celiac Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/celiacdisease.html,Celiac disease is an immune disease in which people can't eat gluten because it will damage their small intestine. If you have celiac disease and eat foods with gluten; your immune system responds by damaging the small intestine.  Gluten is a protein found in wheat; rye; and barley. It may also be in other products like vitamins and supplements; hair and skin products; toothpastes; and lip balm.Celiac disease affects each person differently. Symptoms may occur in the digestive system; or in other parts of the body. One person might have diarrhea and abdominal pain; while another person may be irritable or depressed. Irritability is one of the most common symptoms in children. Some people have no symptoms.Celiac disease is genetic. Blood tests can help your doctor diagnose the disease. Your doctor may also need to examine a small piece of tissue from your small intestine. Treatment is a diet free of gluten. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Electromagnetic Fields,https://medlineplus.gov/electromagneticfields.html,Electric and magnetic fields (EMFs) are areas of energy that surround electrical devices. Everyday sources of EMFs includePower linesElectrical wiringMicrowave ovensComputersCell phonesSome people worry about EMF exposure and cancer. Some studies have found a link between EMF exposure and a higher risk of childhood leukemia; but other studies have not. Other studies have not found proof that EMF exposure causes other childhood cancers. Studies in adults did not prove that EMF exposure causes cancer.Some people worry that wireless and cellular phones cause cancer or other health problems. The phones do give off radio-frequency energy (RF); a form of electromagnetic radiation.  So far; scientific evidence has not found a link between cell phone use and health problems in humans. However; scientists need to do more research on this before they can say for sure. NIH: National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
Cellulitis,https://medlineplus.gov/cellulitis.html,Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and deep underlying tissues. Group A strep (streptococcal) bacteria are the most common cause.  The bacteria enter your body when you get an injury such as a bruise; burn; surgical cut; or wound.Symptoms includeFever and chillsSwollen glands or lymph nodesA rash with painful; red; tender skin. The skin may blister and scab over.Your health care provider may take a sample or culture from your skin or do a blood test to identify the bacteria causing infection. Treatment is with antibiotics. They may be oral in mild cases; or intravenous (by IV) for more severe cases.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Brain Malformations,https://medlineplus.gov/brainmalformations.html,Most brain malformations begin long before a baby is born. Something damages the developing nervous system or causes it to develop abnormally. Sometimes it's a genetic problem. In other cases; exposure to certain medicines; infections; or radiation during pregnancy interferes with brain development. Parts of the brain may be missing; abnormally small or large; or not fully developed.Treatment depends upon the problem. In many cases; treatment only helps with symptoms. It may include antiseizure medicines; shunts to drain fluid from the brain; and physical therapy.There are head malformations that do not involve the brain. Craniofacial disorders are the result of abnormal growth of soft tissue and bones in the face and head. It's common for new babies to have slightly uneven heads; but parents should watch the shape of their baby's head for possible problems.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Cerebellar Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/cerebellardisorders.html,When you play the piano or hit a tennis ball you are activating the cerebellum. The cerebellum is the area of the brain that controls coordination and balance. Problems with the cerebellum includeCancerGenetic disordersAtaxias - failure of muscle control in the arms and legs that result in movement disordersDegeneration - disorders caused by brain cells decreasing in size or wasting awayTreatment of cerebellar disorders depends on the cause. In some cases; there is no cure but treatment may help with symptoms.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Brain Aneurysm,https://medlineplus.gov/brainaneurysm.html,A brain aneurysm is an abnormal bulge or "ballooning" in the wall of an artery in the brain. They are sometimes called berry aneurysms because they are often the size of a small berry. Most brain aneurysms produce no symptoms until they become large; begin to leak blood; or burst.If a brain aneurysm presses on nerves in your brain; it can cause signs and symptoms. These can includeA droopy eyelid Double vision or other changes in vision Pain above or behind the eye A dilated pupil Numbness or weakness on one side of the face or body Treatment depends on the size and location of the aneurysm; whether it is infected; and whether it has burst. If a brain aneurysm bursts; symptoms can include a sudden; severe headache; nausea and vomiting; stiff neck; loss of consciousness; and signs of a stroke. Any of these symptoms requires immediate medical attention.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Hemorrhagic Stroke,https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhagicstroke.html,A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic stroke is the less common type. It happens when a blood vessel breaks and bleeds into the brain. Within minutes; brain cells begin to die. Causes include a bleeding aneurysm; an arteriovenous malformation (AVM); or an artery wall that breaks open.Symptoms of stroke areSudden numbness or weakness of the face; arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)Sudden confusion; trouble speaking or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden trouble walking; dizziness; loss of balance or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeIt is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. With a hemorrhagic stroke; the first steps are to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and then control it.  Surgery may be needed.  Post-stroke rehabilitation can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Cerebral Palsy,https://medlineplus.gov/cerebralpalsy.html,Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect a person's ability to move and to maintain balance and posture. The disorders appear in the first few years of life. Usually they do not get worse over time. People with cerebral palsy may have difficulty walking. They may also have trouble with tasks such as writing or using scissors. Some have other medical conditions; including seizure disorders or mental impairment. Cerebral palsy happens when the areas of the brain that control movement and posture do not develop correctly or get damaged.  Early signs of cerebral palsy usually appear before 3 years of age. Babies with cerebral palsy are often slow to roll over; sit; crawl; smile; or walk. Some babies are born with cerebral palsy; others get it after they are born. There is no cure for cerebral palsy; but treatment can improve the lives of those who have it. Treatment includes medicines; braces; and physical; occupational and speech therapy. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Stroke,https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html,A stroke is a medical emergency. Strokes happen when blood flow to your brain stops. Within minutes; brain cells begin to die.   There are two kinds of stroke. The more common kind; called ischemic stroke; is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. The other kind; called hemorrhagic stroke; is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain.   "Mini-strokes" or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs); occur when the blood supply to the brain is briefly interrupted.Symptoms of stroke are Sudden numbness or weakness of the face; arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)Sudden confusion; trouble speaking or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden trouble walking; dizziness; loss of balance or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeIf you have any of these symptoms; you must get to a hospital quickly to begin treatment. Acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot or by stopping the bleeding.  Post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage.  Drug therapy with blood thinners is the most common treatment for stroke.  NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Cervical Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/cervicalcancer.html,The cervix is the lower part of the uterus; the place where a baby grows during pregnancy. Cervical cancer is caused by a virus called HPV. The virus spreads through sexual contact. Most women's bodies are able to fight HPV infection. But sometimes the virus leads to cancer. You're at higher risk if you smoke; have had many children; use birth control pills for a long time; or have HIV infection. Cervical cancer may not cause any symptoms at first. Later; you may have pelvic pain or bleeding from the vagina. It usually takes several years for normal cells in the cervix to turn into cancer cells. Your health care provider can find abnormal cells by doing a Pap test to examine cells from the cervix. You may also have an HPV test.  If your results are abnormal; you may need a biopsy or other tests. By getting regular screenings; you can find and treat any problems before they turn into cancer.Treatment may include surgery; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; or a combination. The choice of treatment depends on the size of the tumor; whether the cancer has spread and whether you would like to become pregnant someday.Vaccines can protect against several types of HPV; including some that can cause cancer.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Cervical Cancer Screening,https://medlineplus.gov/cervicalcancerscreening.html,The cervix is the lower part of the uterus; the place where a baby grows during pregnancy.  Cancer screening is looking for cancer before you have any symptoms. Cancer found early may be easier to treat.Cervical cancer screening is usually part of a woman's health checkup.  There are two types of tests: the Pap test and the HPV test.   For both; the doctor or nurse collects cells from the surface of the cervix.  With the Pap test; the lab checks the sample for cancer cells or abnormal cells that could become cancer later.  With the HPV test; the lab checks for HPV infection.  HPV is a virus that spreads through sexual contact.  It can sometimes lead to cancer.  If your screening tests are abnormal; your doctor may do more tests; such as a biopsy.Cervical cancer screening has risks.  The results can sometimes be wrong; and you may have unnecessary follow-up tests.  There are also benefits.  Screening has been shown to decrease the number of deaths from cervical cancer. You and your doctor should discuss your risk for cervical cancer; the pros and cons of the screening tests; at what age to start being screened; and how often to be screened.
Cervix Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/cervixdisorders.html,The cervix is the lower part of the uterus; the place where a baby grows during pregnancy. The cervix has a small opening that expands during childbirth. It also allows menstrual blood to leave a woman's body.Your health care provider may perform a Pap test during your health checkup to look for changes to the cells of the cervix; including cervical cancer. Other problems with the cervix include:Cervicitis - inflammation of the cervix. This is usually from an infection.Cervical incompetence - This can happen during pregnancy.  The opening of the cervix widens long before the baby is due.Cervical polyps and cysts - abnormal growths on the cervix
Ectopic Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/ectopicpregnancy.html,The uterus; or womb; is the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant. If you have an ectopic pregnancy; the fertilized egg grows in the wrong place; outside the uterus; usually in the fallopian tubes. The result is usually a miscarriage.Ectopic pregnancy can be a medical emergency if it ruptures. Signs of ectopic pregnancy includeAbdominal painShoulder painVaginal bleedingFeeling dizzy or faintGet medical care right away if you have these signs. Doctors use drugs or surgery to remove the ectopic tissue so it doesn't damage your organs. Many women who have had ectopic pregnancies go on to have healthy pregnancies later.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Neck Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/neckinjuriesanddisorders.html,Any part of your neck - muscles; bones; joints; tendons; ligaments; or nerves - can cause neck problems. Neck pain is very common. Pain may also come from your shoulder; jaw; head; or upper arms. Muscle strain or tension often causes neck pain. The problem is usually overuse; such as from sitting at a computer for too long.  Sometimes you can strain your neck muscles from sleeping in an awkward position or overdoing it during exercise. Falls or accidents; including car accidents; are another common cause of neck pain.  Whiplash; a soft tissue injury to the neck; is also called neck sprain or strain.Treatment depends on the cause; but may include applying ice; taking pain relievers; getting physical therapy or wearing a cervical collar. You rarely need surgery.

Cesarean Section,https://medlineplus.gov/cesareansection.html,A Cesarean section (C-section) is surgery to deliver a baby. The baby is taken out through the mother's abdomen. In the United States; almost one in three women has their babies this way. Some C-sections are planned; but many are done when unexpected problems happen during delivery. Reasons for a C-section may includeHealth problems in the motherThe mother carrying more than one babyThe size or position of the babyThe baby's health is in dangerLabor is not moving along as it shouldThe surgery is relatively safe for mother and baby. Still; it is major surgery and carries risks. It also takes longer to recover from a C-section than from vaginal birth. It can raise the risk of having difficulties with future pregnancies. Some women may have problems attempting a vaginal birth later. Still; many women are able to have a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC).NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/chronicfatiguesyndrome.html,Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disorder that causes extreme fatigue. This fatigue is not the kind of tired feeling that goes away after you rest. Instead; it lasts a long time and limits your ability to do ordinary daily activities.The main symptom of CFS is severe fatigue that lasts for 6 months or more. You also have at least four of these other symptoms:Feeling unwell for more than 24 hours after physical activityMuscle painMemory problemsHeadachesPain in multiple jointsSleep problemsSore throatTender lymph nodesCFS is hard to diagnose. There are no tests for it; and other illnesses can cause similar symptoms. Your doctor has to rule out other diseases before making a diagnosis of CFS.No one knows what causes CFS. It is most common in women in their 40s and 50s; but anyone can have it. It can last for years. There is no cure for CFS; so the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms. CFS affects people in different ways. You should work with your doctors to create a treatment program that best meets your own needs. It may include therapies to manage your symptoms; such as medicines to treat pain; sleep disorders; and other problems. It may also include coping techniques; and ways of managing your daily activities. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Chagas Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/chagasdisease.html,Chagas disease is caused by a parasite. It is common in Latin America but not in the United States. Infected blood-sucking bugs; sometimes called kissing bugs; spread it.  When the bug bites you; usually on your face; it leaves behind infected waste. You can get the infection if you rub it in your eyes or nose; the bite wound or a cut. The disease can also spread through contaminated food; a blood transfusion; a donated organ or from mother to baby during pregnancy.If you notice symptoms; they might includeFeverFlu-like symptomsA rashA swollen eyelidThese early symptoms usually go away. However; if you don't treat the infection; it stays in your body. Later; it can cause serious intestinal and heart problems.A physical exam and blood tests can diagnose it.  You may also need tests to see whether the disease has affected your intestines and heart.Medicines can kill the parasite; especially early on. You can also treat related problems. For example; a pacemaker helps with certain heart complications.There are no vaccines or medicines to prevent Chagas disease. If you travel to areas where it occurs; you are at higher risk if you sleep outdoors or in poor housing conditions. It is important to use insecticides to prevent bites; and practice food safety.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Eyelid Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eyeliddisorders.html,Your eyelids help protect your eyes. When you blink; your eyelids spread moisture over your eyes. Blinking also helps move dirt or other particles off the surface of the eye.  You close your eyelids when you see something coming toward your eyes.  This can help protect against injuries.Like most other parts of your body; your eyelids can get infected; inflamed; or even develop cancer. There are also specific eyelid problems; includingEyelids that turn in or outEyelids that droopAbnormal blinking or twitchingTreatment of eyelid problems depends on the cause.
Menopause,https://medlineplus.gov/menopause.html,Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her period stops.  It usually occurs naturally; most often after age 45. Menopause happens because the woman's ovaries stop producing the hormones estrogen and progesterone. A woman has reached menopause when she has not had a period for one year.  Changes and symptoms can start several years earlier. They includeA change in periods - shorter or longer; lighter or heavier; with more or less time in between Hot flashes and/or night sweats Trouble sleeping Vaginal dryness Mood swingsTrouble focusingLess hair on head; more on face Some symptoms require treatment.  Talk to your doctor about how to best manage menopause.  Make sure the doctor knows your medical history and your family medical history. This includes whether you are at risk for heart disease; osteoporosis; or breast cancer.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/charcotmarietoothdisease.html,Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a group of genetic nerve disorders. It is named after the three doctors who first identified it. In the United States; CMT affects about 1 in 2;500 people. CMT affects your peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves carry movement and sensation signals between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body. Symptoms usually start around the teen years. Foot problems such as high arches or hammertoes can be early symptoms. As CMT progresses; your lower legs may weaken. Later; your hands may also become weak. Doctors diagnose CMT by doing a neurologic exam; nerve tests; genetic tests; or a nerve biopsy. There is no cure. The disease can be so mild you don't realize you have it or severe enough to make you weak. Physical therapy; occupational therapy; braces and other devices and sometimes surgery can help.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Muscle Cramps,https://medlineplus.gov/musclecramps.html,Muscle cramps are sudden; involuntary contractions or spasms in one or more of your muscles. They often occur after exercise or at night; lasting a few seconds to several minutes. It is a very common muscle problem.  Muscle cramps can be caused by nerves that malfunction. Sometimes this malfunction is due to a health problem; such as a spinal cord injury or a pinched nerve in the neck or back. Other causes are  Straining or overusing a muscle Dehydration A lack of minerals in your diet or the depletion of minerals in your body Not enough blood getting to your muscles  Cramps can be very painful. Stretching or gently massaging the muscle can relieve this pain.
Chemical Emergencies,https://medlineplus.gov/chemicalemergencies.html,When a hazardous chemical has been released; it may harm people's health.

Cancer Chemotherapy,https://medlineplus.gov/cancerchemotherapy.html,Normally; your cells grow and die in a controlled way. Cancer cells keep growing without control. Chemotherapy is drug therapy for cancer. It works by killing the cancer cells; stopping them from spreading; or slowing their growth.  However; it can also harm healthy cells; which causes side effects. You may have a lot of side effects; some; or none at all. It depends on the type and amount of chemotherapy you get and how your body reacts. Some common side effects are fatigue; nausea; vomiting; pain; and hair loss. There are ways to prevent or control some side effects. Talk with your health care provider about how to manage them.  Healthy cells usually recover after chemotherapy is over; so most side effects gradually go away.Your treatment plan will depend on the cancer type; the chemotherapy drugs used; the treatment goal; and how your body responds. Chemotherapy may be given alone or with other treatments. You may get treatment every day; every week; or every month. You may have breaks between treatments so that your body has a chance to build new healthy cells. You might take the drugs by mouth; in a shot; as a cream; or intravenously (by IV).NIH: National Cancer Institute
Chest Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/chestinjuriesanddisorders.html,The chest is the part of the body between your neck and your abdomen.  It includes the ribs and breastbone.  Inside your chest are several organs; including the heart; lungs; and esophagus. The pleura; a large thin sheet of tissue; lines the inside of the chest cavity.Chest injuries and disorders includeHeart diseasesLung diseases and collapsed lungPleural disordersEsophagus disordersBroken ribsThoracic aortic aneurysmsDisorders of the mediastinum; the space between the lungs; breastbone; and spine
Chest Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/chestpain.html,Having a pain in your chest can be scary.  It does not always mean that you are having a heart attack.  There can be many other causes; includingOther heart problems; such as anginaPanic attacksDigestive problems; such as heartburn or esophagus disordersSore musclesLung diseases; such as pneumonia; pleurisy; or pulmonary embolismCostochondritis - an inflammation of joints in your chestSome of these problems can be serious.

Heart Failure,https://medlineplus.gov/heartfailure.html,Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Heart failure does not mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. It means that your heart is not able to pump blood the way it should. It can affect one or both sides of the heart.The weakening of the heart's pumping ability causesBlood and fluid to back up into the lungsThe buildup of fluid in the feet; ankles and legs - called edemaTiredness and shortness of breathCommon causes of heart failure are coronary artery disease; high blood pressure and diabetes. It is more common in people who are 65 years old or older; African Americans; people who are overweight; and people who have had a heart attack. Men have a higher rate of heart failure than women.Your doctor will diagnose heart failure by doing a physical exam and heart tests. Treatment includes treating the underlying cause of your heart failure; medicines; and heart transplantation if other treatments fail.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Chiari Malformation,https://medlineplus.gov/chiarimalformation.html,Chiari malformations (CMs) are structural defects in the cerebellum. The cerebellum is the part of the brain that controls balance.  With CM; brain tissue extends into the spinal canal.  It can happen when part of the skull is too small; which pushes the brain tissue down. There are several types of CM. One type often happens in children who have neural tube defects. Some types cause no symptoms and don't need treatment. If you have symptoms; they may includeNeck painBalance problemsNumbness or other abnormal feelings in the arms or legsDizzinessVision problemsDifficulty swallowingPoor hand coordinationDoctors diagnose CM using imaging tests. Medicines may ease some symptoms; such as pain. Surgery is the only treatment available to correct or stop the progression of nerve damage.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Chickenpox,https://medlineplus.gov/chickenpox.html,Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Most cases are in children under age 15; but older children and adults can get it.  It spreads very easily from one person to another.The classic symptom of chickenpox is an uncomfortable; itchy rash. The rash turns into fluid-filled blisters and eventually into scabs. It usually shows up on the face; chest; and back and then spreads to the rest of the body. Other symptoms includeFeverHeadacheTirednessLoss of appetiteChickenpox is usually mild and lasts 5 to 10 days. Calamine lotions and oatmeal baths can help with itching. Acetaminophen can treat the fever. Do not use aspirin for chickenpox; that combination can cause Reye syndrome.Chickenpox can sometimes cause serious problems. Adults; babies; teenagers; pregnant women; and those with weak immune systems tend to get sicker from it. They may need to take antiviral medicines.Once you catch chickenpox; the virus usually stays in your body.  You probably will not get chickenpox again; but the virus can cause shingles in adults. A chickenpox vaccine can help prevent most cases of chickenpox; or make it less severe if you do get it.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Chikungunya,https://medlineplus.gov/chikungunya.html,Chikungunya is a virus that spread by the same kinds of mosquitoes that spread dengue and Zika virus. Rarely; it can spread from mother to newborn around the time of birth. It may also possibly spread through infected blood. There have been outbreaks of chikungunya virus in Africa; Asia; Europe; the Indian and Pacific Oceans; the Caribbean; and Central and South America.Most people who are infected will have symptoms; which can be severe. They usually start 3-7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. The most common symptoms are fever and joint pain. Other symptoms may include headache; muscle pain; joint swelling; and rash.Most people feel better within a week. In some cases; however; the joint pain may last for months. People at risk for more severe disease include newborns; older adults; and people with diseases such as high blood pressure; diabetes; or heart disease.A blood test can show whether you have chikungunya virus. There are no vaccines or medicines to treat it. Drinking lots of fluids; resting; and taking non-aspirin pain relievers might help.The best way to prevent chikungunya infection is to avoid mosquito bites:Use insect repellentWear clothes that cover your arms; legs; and feetStay in places that have air conditioning or that use window and door screensCenters for Disease Control and Prevention
Frostbite,https://medlineplus.gov/frostbite.html,Frostbite is an injury to the body that is caused by freezing. It most often affects the nose; ears; cheeks; chin; fingers; or toes. Frostbite can permanently damage the body; and severe cases can lead to amputation.If you have frostbite; the skin in that area may turn white or grayish-yellow. It may feel firm or waxy when you touch it. The area will also feel numb.If you have symptoms of frostbite; seek medical care. But if immediate medical care isn't available; here are steps to take:Get into a warm room as soon as possible.If possible; do not walk on frostbitten feet or toes. Walking increases the damage.Put the affected area in warm - not hot - water.You can also warm the affected area using body heat. For example; use your armpit to warm frostbitten fingers. Don't rub the frostbitten area with snow or massage it at all. This can cause more damage. Don't use a heating pad; heat lamp; or the heat of a stove; fireplace; or radiator for warming. Since frostbite makes an area numb; you could burn it.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Child Abuse,https://medlineplus.gov/childabuse.html,Child abuse is doing something or failing to do something that results in harm to a child or puts a child at risk of harm. Child abuse can be physical; sexual or emotional. Neglect; or not providing for a child's needs; is also a form of abuse. Most abused children suffer greater emotional than physical damage. An abused child may become depressed. He or she may withdraw; think of suicide or become violent. An older child may use drugs or alcohol; try to run away or abuse others. Child abuse is a serious problem. If you suspect a child is being abused or neglected; call the police or your local child welfare agency.
Child Behavior Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/childbehaviordisorders.html, All kids misbehave some times. And some may have temporary behavior problems due to stress. For example; the birth of a sibling; a divorce; or a death in the family may cause a child to act out. Behavior disorders are more serious. They involve a pattern of hostile; aggressive; or disruptive behaviors for more than 6 months.  The behavior is also not appropriate for the child's age.Warning signs can includeHarming or threatening themselves; other people or petsDamaging or destroying property Lying or stealing Not doing well in school; skipping school Early smoking; drinking or drug use Early sexual activity Frequent tantrums and arguments Consistent hostility toward authority figures  If you see signs of a problem; ask for help. Poor choices can become habits. Kids who have behavior problems are at higher risk for school failure; mental health problems; and even suicide. Classes or family therapy may help parents learn to set and enforce limits. Talk therapy and behavior therapy for your child can also help.
Child Care,https://medlineplus.gov/childcare.html,Children's healthy development depends on safe and positive experiences when they are very young. If you work or go to school; you want to know that your child is in good hands while you are away.  You may choose in-home care; where the caregiver comes to your home.  Or your child might go to the caregiver's home.  Finally; there are child care centers. You need to choose the one that works for your family.  It is important to get to know your child's caregivers. They will be a big part of your child's life. The caregiver's training should involve  Knowledge of how young children learn and grow Positive; consistent discipline Knowledge of the signs that a child is sick Cleanliness and safety practices to help keep kids from getting sick or hurt Basic first aid
Child Dental Health,https://medlineplus.gov/childdentalhealth.html,Healthy teeth are important to your child's overall health. From the time your child is born; there are things you can do to promote healthy teeth and prevent cavities. For babies; you should clean teeth with a soft; clean cloth or baby's toothbrush.  Avoid putting the baby to bed with a bottle and check teeth regularly for spots or stains.For all children; you shouldStart using a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste when they are two years old. You might start sooner; if a dentist or doctor suggests it.Provide healthy foods and limit sweet snacks and drinksSchedule regular dental check-ups Forming good habits at a young age can help your child have healthy teeth for life.

Child Development,https://medlineplus.gov/childdevelopment.html,As children grow older; they develop in several different ways. Child development includes physical; intellectual; social; and emotional changes.Children grow and mature at very different rates. It's hard to say what "normal" is.  There can be big differences in height; weight; and build among healthy children. Diet; exercise and genes are all factors. Some children begin puberty or are close to it before they are teenagers.Children start to become more independent from their parents.  They may rebel.  They also look outward - to their friends; who are usually of the same sex. Peer approval becomes very important. Your child may try new behaviors to be part of "the group." This can also be the time that parents or teachers recognize learning disabilities or behavioral problems in children. These problems can get worse as time goes on; so it is important to get help early.
Child Mental Health,https://medlineplus.gov/childmentalhealth.html,It's important to recognize and treat mental illnesses in children early on.  Once mental illness develops; it becomes a regular part of your child's behavior. This makes it more difficult to treat.But it's not always easy to know when your child has a serious problem. Everyday stresses can cause changes in your child's behavior. For example; getting a new brother or sister or going to a new school may cause a child to temporarily act out. Warning signs that it might be a more serious problem includeProblems in more than one setting (at school; at home; with peers)Changes in appetite or sleepSocial withdrawal or fear of things he or she did not used to be not afraid ofReturning to behaviors more common in younger children; such as bedwettingSigns of being upset; such as sadness or tearfulnessSigns of self-destructive behavior; such as head-banging or suddenly getting hurt oftenRepeated thoughts of deathTo diagnose mental health problems; the doctor or mental health specialist looks at your child's signs and symptoms; medical history; and family history. Treatments include medicines and talk therapy.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
Child Sexual Abuse,https://medlineplus.gov/childsexualabuse.html,Sexual abuse is one form of child abuse. It includes a wide range of actions between a child and an adult or older child. Often these involve body contact; but not always. Exposing one's genitals to children or pressuring them for sex is sexual abuse. Using a child for pornography is also sexual abuse. Most sexual abusers know the child they abuse. They may be family friends; neighbors or babysitters. About one-third of abusers are related to the child. Most abusers are men. If you think a child may have been abused; it's important to report it.
Child Nutrition,https://medlineplus.gov/childnutrition.html,A healthy diet helps children grow and learn. It also helps prevent obesity and weight-related diseases; such as diabetes. To give your child a nutritious dietMake half of what is on your child's plate fruits and vegetablesChoose healthy sources of protein; such as lean meat; nuts; and eggsServe whole-grain breads and cereals because they are high in fiber. Reduce refined grains.Broil; grill; or steam foods instead of frying themLimit fast food and junk foodOffer water or milk instead of sugary fruit drinks and sodasLearn about your children's nutrient requirements. Some of them; such as the requirements for iron and calcium; change as your child ages. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Child Safety,https://medlineplus.gov/childsafety.html,As parents; we want to keep our children safe from harm. Take steps to keep your children safe:Install the right child safety seat in your carTeach children how to cross the street safelyMake sure they wear the right gear and equipment for sportsInstall and test smoke alarms Store medicines; cleaners and other dangerous substances in locked cabinetsBabyproof your homeDon't leave small children unattended

Childbirth,https://medlineplus.gov/childbirth.html,When you are ready to have your baby; you'll go through labor.  Labor is the process of giving birth. Signs that you might be going into labor includeContractions that are regular then start to come closer togetherLeaking fluid or bleeding from the vaginaLow; dull backacheAbdominal crampsCall your health care provider if you have any of these signs; even if it is before your due date. Preterm labor can start before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy.Labor happens in three stages. The first stage begins with contractions. It continues until your cervix has become thinner and dilated (stretched) to about 4 inches wide. The second stage is the active stage; in which you begin to push downward. Crowning is when your baby's scalp comes into view. Shortly afterward; your baby is born. In the third stage; you deliver the placenta. The placenta is the organ that supplied food and oxygen to your baby during pregnancy.Mothers and babies are monitored closely during labor. Most women are able to have a baby through normal vaginal delivery. If there are complications; the baby may need to be delivered surgically by a Cesarean section.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Childbirth Problems,https://medlineplus.gov/childbirthproblems.html,While childbirth usually goes well; complications can happen.  They can cause a risk to the mother; baby; or both.  Possible complications includePreterm (premature) labor; when labor starts before 37 completed weeks of pregnancyProblems with the umbilical cordProblems with the position of the baby; such as breech; in which the baby is going to come out feet firstBirth injuriesFor some of these problems; the baby may need to be delivered surgically by a Cesarean section.
Asthma in Children,https://medlineplus.gov/asthmainchildren.html,Asthma is a chronic disease that affects your airways. Your airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma; the inside walls of your airways become sore and swollen.In the United States; about 20 million people have asthma.  Nearly 9 million of them are children. Children have smaller airways than adults; which makes asthma especially serious for them. Children with asthma may experience wheezing; coughing; chest tightness; and trouble breathing; especially early in the morning or at night. Many things can cause asthma; including Allergens - mold; pollen; animalsIrritants - cigarette smoke; air pollutionWeather - cold air; changes in weatherExercise Infections - flu; common coldWhen asthma symptoms become worse than usual; it is called an asthma attack. Asthma is treated with two kinds of medicines: quick-relief medicines to stop asthma symptoms and long-term control medicines to prevent symptoms.
Childhood Brain Tumors,https://medlineplus.gov/childhoodbraintumors.html,Brain tumors are abnormal growths inside the skull. They are among the most common types of childhood cancers. Some are benign tumors; which aren't cancer. They can still be serious. Malignant tumors are cancerous.Childhood brain and spinal cord tumors can cause headaches and other symptoms. However; other conditions can also cause the same symptoms. Check with a doctor if your child has any of the following problems:Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomitingFrequent nausea and vomitingVision; hearing; and speech problemsLoss of balance or trouble walkingUnusual sleepinessPersonality changesSeizuresIncreased head size in infantsThe symptoms are not the same in every child.Doctors use physical and neurological exams; lab tests; and imaging to diagnose brain tumors. Most childhood brain tumors are diagnosed and removed in surgery.Treatment for children is sometimes different than for an adult. Long-term side effects are an important issue. The options also depend on the type of tumor and where it is. Removal of the tumor is often possible. If not; radiation; chemotherapy; or both may be used.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Cancer in Children,https://medlineplus.gov/cancerinchildren.html,Cancer is a group related diseases. In all types of cancer; some of the body's cells begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues.Normally; new cells form as you need them; replacing old cells that die. Sometimes; this process goes wrong. New cells form when you don't need them; and old cells don't die when they should. The extra cells can form a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumorsaren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body.Children can get cancer in the same parts of the body as adults; but there are differences. Childhood cancers can occur suddenly; without early symptoms; and have a high rate of cure. The most common children's cancer is leukemia. Other cancers that affect children include brain tumors; lymphoma; and soft tissue sarcoma.Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Treatments include surgery; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; stem cell transplants; and/or targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Childhood Immunization,https://medlineplus.gov/childhoodimmunization.html,Today; children in the United States routinely get vaccines that protect them from more than a dozen diseases such as measles; polio; tetanus; diphtheria; and pertussis (whooping cough). Most of these diseases are now at their lowest levels in history; thanks to years of immunization. Children must get at least some vaccines before they may attend school.Vaccines help make you immune to serious diseases without getting sick first. Without a vaccine; you must actually get a disease in order to become immune to the germ that causes it. Vaccines work best when they are given at certain ages. For example; children don't receive measles vaccine until they are at least one year old. If it is given earlier it might not work as well.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes a schedule for childhood vaccines.Although some of the vaccines you receive as a child provide protection for many years; adults need immunizations too.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Childhood Leukemia,https://medlineplus.gov/childhoodleukemia.html,Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. It is the most common type of childhood cancer. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. White blood cells help your body fight infection. In leukemia; the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells; making it hard for blood to do its work.Leukemia can develop quickly or slowly. Acute leukemia is a fast growing type while chronic leukemia grows slowly. Children with leukemia usually have one of the acute types. Symptoms includeInfectionsFeverLoss of appetiteTirednessEasy bruising or bleedingSwollen lymph nodesNight sweatsShortness of breathPain in the bones or jointsRisk factors for childhood leukemia include having a brother or sister with leukemia; having certain genetic disorders and having had radiation or chemotherapy. Treatment often cures childhood leukemia. Treatment options include chemotherapy; other drug therapy and radiation. In some cases bone marrow and blood stem cell transplantation might help. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Obesity in Children,https://medlineplus.gov/obesityinchildren.html,Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight; which means weighing too much. Both terms mean that a person's weight is greater than what's considered healthy for his or her height.  Children grow at different rates; so it isn't always easy to know when a child has obesity or is overweight. Ask your health care provider to check whether your child's weight and height are in a healthy range.If a weight-loss program is necessary; involve the whole family in healthy habits so your child doesn't feel singled out.  Encourage healthy eating byServing more fruits and vegetablesBuying fewer soft drinks and high-fat; high-calorie snack foodsMaking sure your child eats breakfast every dayEating fast food less oftenNot using food as a rewardPhysical activity is also very important. Kids need about 60 minutes each day. It does not have to happen all at once. Several short periods of activity during the day are just as good.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Diabetes in Children and Teens,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetesinchildrenandteens.html,Until recently; the common type of diabetes in children and teens was type 1. It was called juvenile diabetes. With Type 1 diabetes; the pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose;or sugar; get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin; too much sugar stays in the blood.Now younger people are also getting type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes. But now it is becoming more common in children and teens; due to more obesity. With Type 2 diabetes; the body does not make or use insulin well.Children have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if they  are overweight or have obesity; have a family history of diabetes; or are not active. Children who are African American; Hispanic; Native American/Alaska Native; Asian American; or Pacific Islander also have a higher risk. To lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in childrenHave them maintain a healthy weightBe sure they are physically activeHave them eat smaller portions of healthy foodsLimit time with the TV; computer; and videoChildren and teens with type 1 diabetes may need to take insulin. Type 2 diabetes may be  controlled with diet and exercise. If not; patients will need to take oral diabetes medicines or insulin. A blood test called the A1C can check on how you are managing your diabetes.
Medicines and Children,https://medlineplus.gov/medicinesandchildren.html,When it comes to taking medicines; kids aren't just small adults. For prescription medicines; there is a "Pediatric" section of the label. It says whether the medication has been studied for its effects on children. It also tells you what ages have been studied. Aside from drugs for fever or pain; most over-the-counter products haven't actually been studied in children for effectiveness; safety; or dosing. When you give medicine to your child; be sure you're giving the right medicine and the right amount. Read and follow the label directions.  Use the correct dosing device. If the label says two teaspoons and you're using a dosing cup with ounces only; don't guess. Get the proper measuring device. Don't substitute another item; such as a kitchen spoon. Talk to your doctor; pharmacist; or other health care provider before giving two medicines at the same time. That way; you can avoid a possible overdose or an unwanted interaction. Follow age and weight limit recommendations. If the label says don't give to children under a certain age or weight; don't do it. Food and Drug Administration
Children's Health,https://medlineplus.gov/childrenshealth.html,Your child's health includes physical; mental and social well-being. Most parents know the basics of keeping children healthy; like offering them healthy foods; making sure they get enough sleep and exercise and insuring their safety. It is also important for children to get regular checkups with their health care provider. These visits are a chance to check your child's development. They are also a good time to catch or prevent problems.Other than checkups; school-age children should be seen forSignificant weight gain or lossSleep problems or change in behaviorFever higher than 102Rashes or skin infectionsFrequent sore throatsBreathing problems

Chiropractic,https://medlineplus.gov/chiropractic.html,Chiropractic is a health care profession. Chiropractors perform adjustments (manipulations) to the spine or other parts of the body. The goal is to correct alignment problems; ease pain; and support the body's natural ability to heal itself. They may also use other treatments including Heat and iceElectrical stimulationRelaxation techniquesRehabilitative and general exerciseCounseling about diet; weight loss; and other lifestyle factorsDietary supplementsMany people visit chiropractors for treatment of low back pain; neck pain; and headaches.NIH: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health
Chlamydia Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/chlamydiainfections.html,What is chlamydia?Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted disease. It is caused by bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis. It can infect both men and women. Women can get chlamydia in the cervix; rectum; or throat. Men can get chlamydia in the urethra (inside the penis); rectum; or throat.How do you get chlamydia?You can get chlamydia during oral; vaginal; or anal sex with someone who has the infection. A woman can also pass chlamydia to her baby during childbirth.If you've had chlamydia and were treated in the past; you can get re-infected if you have unprotected sex with someone who has it.Who is at risk of getting chlamydia?Chlamydia is more common in young people; especially young women. You are more likely to get it if you don't consistently use a condom; or if you have multiple partners.What are the symptoms of chlamydia?Chlamydia doesn't usually cause any symptoms. So you may not realize that you have it. People with chlamydia who have no symptoms can still pass the disease to others. If you do have symptoms; they may not appear until several weeks after you have sex with an infected partner.Symptoms in women includeAbnormal vaginal discharge; which may have a strong smellA burning sensation when urinatingPain during intercourseIf the infection spreads; you might get lower abdominal pain; pain during sex; nausea; or fever.Symptoms in men includeDischarge from your penisA burning sensation when urinatingBurning or itching around the opening of your penisPain and swelling in one or both testicles (although this is less common)If the chlamydia infects the rectum (in men or women); it can cause rectal pain; discharge; and/or bleeding.How do I know if I have chlamydia?There are lab tests to diagnose chlamydia. Your health care provider may ask you to provide a urine sample. For women; providers sometimes use (or ask you to use) a cotton swab to get a sample from your vagina to test for chlamydia.Who should be tested for chlamydia?You should go to your health provider for a test if you have symptoms of chlamydia; or if you have a partner who has a sexually transmitted disease. Pregnant women should get a test when they go to their first prenatal visit.People at higher risk should get checked for chlamydia every year:Sexually active women 25 and youngerOlder women who have new or multiple sex partners; or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted diseaseMen who have sex with men (MSM)What are the complications of chlamydia?In women; an untreated infection can spread to your uterus and fallopian tubes; causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause permanent damage to your reproductive system. This can lead to long-term pelvic pain; infertility; and ectopic pregnancy. Women who have had chlamydia infections more than once are at higher risk of serious reproductive health complications.Men often don't have health problems from chlamydia. Sometimes it can infect the epididymis (the tube that carries sperm). This can cause pain; fever; and; rarely; infertility.Both men and women can develop reactive arthritis because of a chlamydia infection. Reactive arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens as a "reaction" to an infection in the body.Babies born to infected mothers can get eye infections and pneumonia from chlamydia. It may also make it more likely for your baby to be born too early.Untreated chlamydia may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV/AIDS.What are the treatments for chlamydia?Antibiotics will cure the infection. You may get a one-time dose of the antibiotics; or you may need to take medicine every day for 7 days. Antibiotics cannot repair any permanent damage that the disease has caused.To prevent spreading the disease to your partner; you should not have sex until the infection has cleared up. If you got a one-time dose of antibiotics; you should wait 7 days after taking the medicine to have sex again. If you have to take medicine every day for 7 days; you should not have sex again until you have finished taking all of the doses of your medicine.It is common to get a repeat infection; so you should get tested again about three months after treatment.Can I prevent chlamydia?The only sure way to prevent chlamydia is to not have vaginal; anal; or oral sex.Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces; but does not eliminate; the risk of catching or spreading chlamydia.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Choking,https://medlineplus.gov/choking.html,Food or small objects can cause choking if they get caught in your throat and block your airway. This keeps oxygen from getting to your lungs and brain. If your brain goes without oxygen for more than four minutes; you could have brain damage or die.Young children are at an especially high risk of choking. They can choke on foods like hot dogs; nuts and grapes; and on small objects like toy pieces and coins. Keep hazards out of their reach and supervise them when they eat.When someone is choking; quick action can be lifesaving. Learn how to do back blows; the Heimlich maneuver (abdominal thrusts); and CPR.
Bile Duct Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/bileductcancer.html,Your liver makes a digestive juice called bile. Your gallbladder stores it between meals. When you eat; your gallbladder pushes the bile into tubes called bile ducts. They carry the bile to your small intestine. The bile helps break down fat. It also helps the liver get rid of toxins and wastes.Bile duct cancer is rare. It can happen in the parts of the bile ducts that are outside or inside the liver. Cancer of the bile duct outside of the liver is much more common. Risk factors include having inflammation of the bile duct; ulcerative colitis; and some liver diseases.Symptoms can includeJaundiceItchy skinFeverAbdominal painTests to diagnose bile duct cancer may include a physical exam; imaging tests of the liver and bile ducts; blood tests; and a biopsy.Treatments include surgery; radiation therapy; and chemotherapy.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Bile Duct Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/bileductdiseases.html,Your liver makes a digestive juice called bile. Your gallbladder stores it between meals. When you eat; your gallbladder pushes the bile into tubes called bile ducts. They carry the bile to your small intestine. The bile helps break down fat. It also helps the liver get rid of toxins and wastes.Different diseases can block the bile ducts and cause a problem with the flow of bile:Gallstones; which can increase pressure in the gallbladder and cause a gallbladder attack. The pain usually lasts from one to several hours.CancerInfectionsBirth defects; such as biliary atresia.  It is the most common reason for liver transplants in children in the United States.Inflammation; which can cause scarring. Over time; this can lead to liver failure.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Gallbladder Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/gallbladderdiseases.html,Your gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ under your liver. It stores bile; a fluid made by your liver to digest fat. As your stomach and intestines digest food; your gallbladder releases bile through a tube called the common bile duct. The duct connects your gallbladder and liver to your small intestine.Your gallbladder is most likely to give you trouble if something blocks the flow of bile through the bile ducts. That is usually a gallstone. Gallstones form when substances in bile harden. Rarely; you can also get cancer in your gallbladder.Many gallbladder problems get better with removal of the gallbladder. Fortunately; you can live without a gallbladder. Bile has other ways of reaching your small intestine.

Cholera,https://medlineplus.gov/cholera.html,Cholera is a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea. The cholera bacterium is usually found in water or food that has been contaminated by feces (poop). Cholera is rare in the US. You may get it if you travel to parts of the world with poor water and sewage treatment. Outbreaks can also happen after disasters. The disease is not likely to spread directly from person to person.Cholera infections are often mild. Some people don't have any symptoms. If you do get symptoms; they usually start 2 to 3 days after infection. The most common symptom is watery diarrhea.In some cases; the infection can be severe; causing  lots of watery diarrhea; vomiting; and leg cramps. Because you quickly lose body fluids; you are at risk for dehydration and shock. Without treatment; you could die within hours. If you think that you might have cholera; you should get medical care right away.Doctors diagnose cholera with a stool sample or rectal swab. Treatment is the replacement of the fluid and salts that you lost through the diarrhea. This is usually with a rehydration solution that you drink. People with severe cases may need an I.V. to replace the fluids. Some of them may also need antibiotics. Most people who get fluid replacement right away will recover.There are vaccines to prevent cholera. One of them is available for adults in the U.S. Very few Americans need it; because most people do not visit areas that have an active cholera outbreak.There are also simple steps you can take to help to prevent cholera infection:Use only bottled or purified water for drinking; washing dishes; making ice cubes; and brushing your teethIf you do use tap water; boil it or use iodine tabletsWash your hands often with soap and clean waterMake sure that the cooked food you eat is fully cooked and served hotAvoid unwashed or unpeeled raw fruits and vegetablesCenters for Disease Control and Prevention

Cholesterol,https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterol.html,Cholesterol is a waxy; fat-like substance that occurs naturally in all parts of the body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much in your blood; it can combine with other substances in the blood and stick to the walls of your arteries. This is called plaque. Plaque can narrow your arteries or even block them.High levels of cholesterol in the blood can increase your risk of heart disease. Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older. There are usually no signs or symptoms that you have high blood cholesterol; but it can be detected with a blood test. You are likely to have high cholesterol if members of your family have it; if you are overweight or if you eat a lot of fatty foods.You can lower your cholesterol by exercising more and eating more fruits and vegetables. You also may need to take medicine to lower your cholesterol.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Gout,https://medlineplus.gov/gout.html,Gout is a common; painful form of arthritis. It causes swollen; red; hot and stiff joints.Gout happens when uric acid builds up in your body.  Uric acid comes from the breakdown of substances called purines. Purines are in your body's tissues and in foods; such as liver; dried beans and peas; and anchovies. Normally; uric acid dissolves in the blood. It passes through the kidneys and out of the body in urine. But sometimes uric acid can build up and form needle-like crystals. When they form in your joints; it is very painful. The crystals can also cause kidney stones.Often; gout first attacks your big toe. It can also attack ankles; heels; knees; wrists; fingers; and elbows. At first; gout attacks usually get better in days. Eventually; attacks last longer and happen more often.You are more likely to get gout if youAre a manHave family member with goutAre overweightDrink alcoholEat too many foods rich in purinesGout can be hard to diagnose. Your doctor may take a sample of fluid from an inflamed joint to look for crystals. You can treat gout with medicines.Pseudogout has similar symptoms and is sometimes confused with gout.  However; it is caused by calcium phosphate; not uric acid.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Knee Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/kneeinjuriesanddisorders.html,Your knee joint is made up of bone; cartilage; ligaments and fluid. Muscles and tendons help the knee joint move. When any of these structures is hurt or diseased; you have knee problems. Knee problems can cause pain and difficulty walking.Knee problems are very common; and they occur in people of all ages. Knee problems can interfere with many things; from participation in sports to simply getting up from a chair and walking. This can have a big impact on your life.The most common disease affecting the knee is osteoarthritis. The cartilage in the knee gradually wears away; causing pain and swelling.Injuries to ligaments and tendons also cause knee problems. A common injury is to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). You usually injure your ACL by a sudden twisting motion. ACL and other knee injuries are common sports injuries.Treatment of knee problems depends on the cause. In some cases your doctor may recommend knee replacement.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Choosing a Doctor or Health Care Service,https://medlineplus.gov/choosingadoctororhealthcareservice.html,We all want high-quality health care; but it's hard to know how to choose. There are many things to consider; includingWhat your insurance coversWhether a health care provider or service is accreditedThe location of a serviceHours that the service is availableWhether you like a health care provider's personality On this page you'll find information to help you choose a health care provider or service.
Movement Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/movementdisorders.html,Imagine if parts of your body moved when you didn't want them to. If you have a movement disorder; you experience these kinds of impaired movement. Dyskinesia is abnormal uncontrolled movement and is a common symptom of many movement disorders. Tremors are a type of dyskinesia. Nerve diseases cause many movement disorders; such as Parkinson's disease. Other causes include injuries; autoimmune diseases; infections and certain medicines. Many movement disorders are inherited; which means they run in families.Treatment varies by disorder. Medicine can cure some disorders. Others get better when an underlying disease is treated. Often; however; there is no cure. In that case; the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms and relieve pain.
Prenatal Testing,https://medlineplus.gov/prenataltesting.html,Prenatal testing provides information about your baby's health before he or she is born. Some routine tests during pregnancy also check on your health. At your first prenatal visit; your health care provider will test for a number of things; including problems with your blood; signs of infections; and whether you are immune to rubella (German measles) and chickenpox.Throughout your pregnancy; your health care provider may suggest a number of other tests; too. Some tests are suggested for all women; such as screenings for gestational diabetes; Down syndrome; and HIV. Other tests might be offered based on your:AgePersonal or family health historyEthnic backgroundResults of routine testsSome tests are screening tests. They detect risks for or signs of possible health problems in you or your baby. Based on screening test results; your doctor might suggest diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests confirm or rule out health problems in you or your baby. Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Minerals,https://medlineplus.gov/minerals.html,Minerals are important for your body to stay healthy. Your body uses minerals for many different jobs; including keeping your bones; muscles; heart; and brain working properly. Minerals are also important for making enzymes and hormones.There are two kinds of minerals: macrominerals and trace minerals. You need larger amounts of macrominerals. They include calcium; phosphorus; magnesium; sodium; potassium; chloride and sulfur. You only need small amounts of trace minerals. They include iron; manganese; copper; iodine; zinc; cobalt; fluoride and selenium. Most people get the amount of minerals they need by eating a wide variety of foods. In some cases; your doctor may recommend a mineral supplement. People who have certain health problems or take some medicines may need to get less of one of the minerals. For example; people with chronic kidney disease need to limit foods that are high in potassium.
Chronic Bronchitis,https://medlineplus.gov/chronicbronchitis.html,Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes; the airways that carry air to your lungs. It causes a cough that often brings up mucus. It can also cause shortness of breath; wheezing; a low fever; and chest tightness. There are two main types of bronchitis: acute and chronic. Chronic bronchitis is one type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The inflamed bronchial tubes produce a lot of mucus. This leads to coughing and difficulty breathing. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause. Breathing in air pollution; fumes; or dust over a long period of time may also cause it.To diagnose chronic bronchitis; your doctor will look at your signs and symptoms and listen to your breathing. You may also have other tests.Chronic bronchitis is a long-term condition that keeps coming back or never goes away completely. If you smoke; it is important to quit. Treatment can help with your symptoms. It often includes medicines to open your airways and help clear away mucus. You may also need oxygen therapy. Pulmonary rehabilitation may help you manage better in daily life.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/chronicfatiguesyndrome.html,Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disorder that causes extreme fatigue. This fatigue is not the kind of tired feeling that goes away after you rest. Instead; it lasts a long time and limits your ability to do ordinary daily activities.The main symptom of CFS is severe fatigue that lasts for 6 months or more. You also have at least four of these other symptoms:Feeling unwell for more than 24 hours after physical activityMuscle painMemory problemsHeadachesPain in multiple jointsSleep problemsSore throatTender lymph nodesCFS is hard to diagnose. There are no tests for it; and other illnesses can cause similar symptoms. Your doctor has to rule out other diseases before making a diagnosis of CFS.No one knows what causes CFS. It is most common in women in their 40s and 50s; but anyone can have it. It can last for years. There is no cure for CFS; so the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms. CFS affects people in different ways. You should work with your doctors to create a treatment program that best meets your own needs. It may include therapies to manage your symptoms; such as medicines to treat pain; sleep disorders; and other problems. It may also include coping techniques; and ways of managing your daily activities. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia,https://medlineplus.gov/chronicmyeloidleukemia.html,Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infection. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. In leukemia; the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells; making it hard for blood to do its work. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); there are too many granulocytes; a type of white blood cell.Most people with CML have a gene mutation (change) called the Philadelphia chromosome.Sometimes CML does not cause any symptoms. If you have symptoms; they may include:FatigueWeight lossNight sweatsFeverPain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left sideTests that examine the blood and bone marrow diagnose CML. Treatments include chemotherapy; stem cell transplants; infusion of donated white blood cells following stem cell transplants; surgery to remove the spleen; and biologic and targeted therapies.  Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Immune System and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/immunesystemanddisorders.html,Your immune system is a complex network of cells; tissues; and organs that work together to defend against germs. It helps your body to recognize these "foreign" invaders. Then its job is to keep them out; or if it can't; to find and destroy them.If your immune system cannot do its job; the results can be serious. Disorders of the immune system includeAllergy and asthma - immune responses to substances that are usually not harmfulImmune deficiency diseases - disorders in which the immune system is missing one or more of its partsAutoimmune diseases - diseases causing your immune system to attack your own body's cells and tissues by mistakeNIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

Chronic Kidney Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/chronickidneydisease.html,You have two kidneys; each about the size of your fist.  Their main job is to filter your blood. They remove wastes and extra water; which become urine. They also keep the body's chemicals balanced; help control blood pressure; and make hormones.Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means that your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood as they should. This damage can cause wastes to build up in your body. It can also cause other problems that can harm your health. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of CKD.The kidney damage occurs slowly over many years. Many people don't have any symptoms until their kidney disease is very advanced. Blood and urine tests are the only way to know if you have kidney disease.Treatments cannot cure kidney disease; but they may slow kidney disease. They include medicines to lower blood pressure; control blood sugar; and lower cholesterol. CKD may still get worse over time. Sometimes it can lead to kidney failure. If your kidneys fail; you will need  dialysis or a kidney transplantation.You can take steps to keep your kidneys healthier longer:Choose foods with less  salt (sodium)Control your blood pressure; your health care provider can tell you what your blood pressure should beKeep your blood sugar in the target range; if you have diabetesLimit the amount of alcohol you drinkChoose foods that are healthy for your heart: fruits; vegetables; whole grains; and low-fat dairy foodsLose weight if you are overweightBe physically activeDon't smokeNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Chronic Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/chronicpain.html,Pain is a signal in your nervous system that something may be wrong.  It is an unpleasant feeling; such as a prick; tingle; sting; burn; or ache. Pain may be sharp or dull. You may feel pain in one area of your body; or all over.  There are two types: acute pain and chronic pain. Acute pain lets you know that you may be injured or a have problem you need to take care of. Chronic pain is different.  The pain may last for weeks; months; or even years. The original cause may have been an injury or infection. There may be an ongoing cause of pain; such as arthritis or cancer. In some cases there is no clear cause. Environmental and psychological factors can make chronic pain worse.Many older adults have chronic pain. Women also report having more chronic pain than men; and they are at a greater risk for many pain conditions. Some people have two or more chronic pain conditions.Chronic pain is not always curable; but treatments can help. They includePain Relievers and other medicinesAcupunctureElectrical stimulationSurgeryPhysical therapyPsychotherapyRelaxation and meditation therapyBiofeedbackNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Pancreatitis,https://medlineplus.gov/pancreatitis.html,The pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach and close to the first part of the small intestine. It secretes digestive juices into the small intestine through a tube called the pancreatic duct. The pancreas also releases the hormones insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream.Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. It happens when digestive enzymes start digesting the pancreas itself. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Either form is serious and can lead to complications.Acute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and usually goes away in a few days with treatment. It is often caused by gallstones.  Common symptoms are severe pain in the upper abdomen; nausea; and vomiting.   Treatment is usually a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids; antibiotics; and medicines to relieve pain.Chronic pancreatitis does not heal or improve. It gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. The most common cause is heavy alcohol use. Other causes include cystic fibrosis and other inherited disorders; high levels of calcium or fats in the blood; some medicines; and autoimmune conditions. Symptoms include nausea; vomiting; weight loss; and oily stools. Treatment may also be a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids; medicines to relieve pain; and nutritional support. After that; you may need to start taking enzymes and eat a special diet.  It is also important to not smoke or drink alcohol.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Eosinophilic Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eosinophilicdisorders.html,Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. They help fight off infections and play a role in your body's immune response.  They can also build up and cause inflammation.Normally your blood doesn't have a large number of eosinophils.  Your body may produce more of them in response toAllergic disordersSkin conditionsParasitic and fungal infectionsAutoimmune diseasesSome cancersBone marrow disordersIn some conditions; the eosinophils can move outside the bloodstream and build up in organs and tissues. Treatment of the problem depends on the cause.
Scars,https://medlineplus.gov/scars.html,A scar is a permanent patch of skin that grows over a wound. It forms when your body heals itself after a cut; scrape; burn; or sore. You can also get scars from surgery that cuts through the skin; infections like chickenpox; or skin conditions like acne. Scars are often thicker; as well as pinker; redder; or shinier; than the rest of your skin. How your scar looks depends onHow big and deep your wound isWhere it is How long it takes to heal Your ageYour inherited tendency to scarScars usually fade over time but never go away completely. If the way a scar looks bothers you; various treatments might minimize it. These include surgical revision; dermabrasion; laser treatments; injections; chemical peels; and creams.
Vascular Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/vasculardiseases.html,The vascular system is the body's network of blood vessels. It includes the arteries; veins and capillaries that carry blood to and from the heart. Problems of the vascular system are common and can be serious. Arteries can become thick and stiff; a problem called atherosclerosis. Blood clots can clog vessels and block blood flow to the heart or brain. Weakened blood vessels can burst; causing bleeding inside the body. You are more likely to have vascular disease as you get older. Other factors that make vascular disease more likely include Family history of vascular or heart diseases Pregnancy Illness or injury  Long periods of sitting or standing still Any condition that affects the heart and blood vessels; such as diabetes or high cholesterol  Smoking  Obesity Losing weight; eating healthy foods; being active and not smoking can help vascular disease. Other treatments include medicines and surgery.
Circumcision,https://medlineplus.gov/circumcision.html,Circumcision is a surgical procedure to remove the foreskin; the skin that covers the tip of the penis. In the United States; it is often done before a new baby leaves the hospital. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP); there are medical benefits and risks to circumcision. Possible benefits include a lower risk of urinary tract infections; penile cancer; and sexually transmitted diseases. There is a low risk of bleeding or infection. The baby might also feel some pain.The AAP said that because of the possible benefits; parents should have the option to circumcise their sons. They recommend that parents discuss circumcision with their baby's health care provider. Parents should make their decision based on the benefits and risks; as well as their own religious; cultural; and personal preferences.
Cirrhosis,https://medlineplus.gov/cirrhosis.html,Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver. Scar tissue forms because of injury or long-term disease. Scar tissue cannot do what healthy liver tissue does - make protein; help fight infections; clean the blood; help digest food and store energy.   Cirrhosis can lead to  Easy bruising or bleeding; or nosebleedsSwelling of the abdomen or legs Extra sensitivity to medicinesHigh blood pressure in the vein entering the liverEnlarged veins called varices in the esophagus and stomach. Varices can bleed suddenly. Kidney failureJaundiceSevere itchingGallstonesA small number of people with cirrhosis get liver cancer.Your doctor will diagnose cirrhosis with blood tests; imaging tests; or a biopsy.Cirrhosis has many causes. In the United States; the most common causes are chronic alcoholism and hepatitis. Nothing will make the scar tissue disappear; but treating the cause can keep it from getting worse. If too much scar tissue forms; you may need to consider a liver transplant.  NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/creutzfeldtjakobdisease.html,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare; degenerative brain disorder. Symptoms usually start around age 60. Memory problems; behavior changes; vision problems; and poor muscle coordination progress quickly to dementia; coma; and death. Most patients die within a year.The three main categories of CJD are  Sporadic CJD; which occurs for no known reason Hereditary CJD; which runs in familiesAcquired CJD; which occurs from contact with infected tissue; usually during a medical procedureCattle can get a disease related to CJD called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow disease."  There is concern that people can get a variant of CJD from eating beef from an infected animal; but there is no direct proof to support this.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

Gonorrhea,https://medlineplus.gov/gonorrhea.html,Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease.  It is most common in young adults. The bacteria that cause gonorrhea can infect the genital tract; mouth; or anus. You can get gonorrhea during vaginal; oral; or anal sex with an infected partner.   A pregnant woman can pass it to her baby during childbirth.Gonorrhea does not always cause symptoms. In men; gonorrhea can cause pain when urinating and discharge from the penis. If untreated; it can cause problems with the prostate and testicles.In women; the early symptoms of gonorrhea often are mild. Later; it can cause bleeding between periods; pain when urinating; and increased discharge from the vagina. If untreated; it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease; which causes problems with pregnancy and infertility.Your health care provider will diagnose gonorrhea with lab tests. Treatment is with antibiotics. Treating gonorrhea is becoming more difficult because drug-resistant strains are increasing. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces; but does not eliminate; the risk of catching or spreading gonorrhea.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Leg Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/leginjuriesanddisorders.html,Your legs are made up of bones; blood vessels; muscles; and other connective tissue. They are important for motion and standing. Playing sports; running; falling; or having an accident can damage your legs. Common leg injuries include sprains and strains; joint dislocations; and fractures.These injuries can affect the entire leg; or just the foot; ankle; knee; or hip. Certain diseases also lead to leg problems. For example; knee osteoarthritis; common in older people; can cause pain and limited motion. Problems in your veins in your legs can lead to varicose veins or deep vein thrombosis.
Peripheral Arterial Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/peripheralarterialdisease.html,Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) happens when there is a narrowing of the blood vessels outside of your heart. The cause of PAD is atherosclerosis. This happens when plaque builds up on the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the arms and legs. Plaque is a substance made up of fat and cholesterol. It causes the arteries to narrow or become blocked. This can reduce or stop blood flow; usually to the legs. If severe enough; blocked blood flow can cause tissue death and can sometimes lead to amputation of the foot or leg.The main risk factor for PAD is smoking. Other risk factors include older age and diseases like diabetes; high blood cholesterol; high blood pressure; heart disease; and stroke.Many people who have PAD don't have any symptoms. If you have symptoms; they may includePain; numbness; achiness; or heaviness in the leg muscles. This happens when walking or climbing stairs.Weak or absent pulses in the legs or feetSores or wounds on the toes; feet; or legs that heal slowly; poorly; or not at allA pale or bluish color to the skinA lower temperature in one leg than the other legPoor nail growth on the toes and decreased hair growth on the legsErectile dysfunction; especially among men who have diabetesPAD can increase your risk of heart attack; stroke; and transient ischemic attack.Doctors diagnose PAD with a physical exam and heart and imaging tests. Treatments include lifestyle changes; medicines; and sometimes surgery. Lifestyle changes include dietary changes; exercise; and efforts to lower high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Shoulder Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/shoulderinjuriesanddisorders.html,Your shoulder joint is composed of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone); the scapula (shoulder blade); and the humerus (upper arm bone). Your shoulders are the most movable joints in your body. They can also be unstable because the ball of the upper arm is larger than the shoulder socket that holds it. To remain in a stable or normal position; the shoulder must be anchored by muscles; tendons; and ligaments.Because your shoulder can be unstable; it can be easily injured. Common problems includeSprains and strainsDislocationsSeparationsTendinitisBursitisTorn rotator cuffsFrozen shoulderFracturesArthritisHealth care providers diagnose shoulder problems by using your medical history; a physical exam; and imaging tests.Often; the first treatment for shoulder problems is RICE. This stands for Rest; Ice; Compression; and Elevation. Other treatments include exercise and medicines to reduce pain and swelling. If those don't work; you may need surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases

Cleft Lip and Palate,https://medlineplus.gov/cleftlipandpalate.html,Cleft lip and cleft palate are birth defects that occur when a baby's lip or mouth do not form properly.  They happen early during pregnancy. A baby can have a cleft lip; a cleft palate; or both.A cleft lip happens if the tissue that makes up the lip does not join completely before birth. This causes an opening in the upper lip. The opening can be a small slit or a large opening that goes through the lip into the nose. It can be on one or both sides of the lip or; rarely; in the middle of the lip.Children with a cleft lip also can have a cleft palate. The roof of the mouth is called the "palate." With a cleft palate; the tissue that makes up the roof of the mouth does not join correctly.  Babies may have both the front and back parts of the palate open; or they may have only one part open.Children with a cleft lip or a cleft palate often have problems with feeding and talking. They also might have ear infections; hearing loss; and problems with their teeth.Often; surgery can close the lip and palate. Cleft lip surgery is usually done before age 12 months; and cleft palate surgery is done before 18 months. Many children have other complications. They may need additional surgeries; dental and orthodontic care; and speech therapy as they get older. With treatment; most children with clefts do well and lead a healthy life.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Spina Bifida,https://medlineplus.gov/spinabifida.html,Spina bifida is a neural tube defect - a type of birth defect of the brain; spine; or spinal cord. It happens if the spinal column of the fetus doesn't close completely during the first month of pregnancy. This can damage the nerves and spinal cord. Screening tests during pregnancy can check for spina bifida. Sometimes it is discovered only after the baby is born.The symptoms of spina bifida vary from person to person. Most people with spina bifida are of normal intelligence. Some people need assistive devices such as braces; crutches; or wheelchairs. They may have learning difficulties; urinary and bowel problems; or hydrocephalus; a buildup of fluid in the brain.The exact cause of spina bifida is unknown. It seems to run in families. Taking folic acid can reduce the risk of having a baby with spina bifida. It's in most multivitamins. Women who could become pregnant should take it daily.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

Clinical Trials,https://medlineplus.gov/clinicaltrials.html,Clinical trials are research studies that test how well new medical approaches work in people. Each study answers scientific questions and tries to find better ways to prevent; screen for; diagnose; or treat a disease. Clinical trials may also compare a new treatment to a treatment that is already available.Every clinical trial has a protocol; or action plan; for conducting the trial. The plan describes what will be done in the study; how it will be conducted; and why each part of the study is necessary. Each study has its own rules about who can take part. Some studies need volunteers with a certain disease. Some need healthy people. Others want just men or just women.An Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews; monitors; and approves many clinical trials. It is an independent committee of physicians; statisticians; and members of the community. Its role is toMake sure that the study is ethicalProtect the rights and welfare of the participantsMake sure that the risks are reasonable when compared to the potential benefitsIn the United States; a clinical trial must have an IRB if it is studying a drug; biological product; or medical device that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates; or it is funded or carried out by the federal government.NIH: National Institutes of Health

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); there are too many granulocytes; a type of white blood cell.Most people with CML have a gene mutation (change) called the Philadelphia chromosome.Sometimes CML does not cause any symptoms. If you have symptoms; they may include:FatigueWeight lossNight sweatsFeverPain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left sideTests that examine the blood and bone marrow diagnose CML. Treatments include chemotherapy; stem cell transplants; infusion of donated white blood cells following stem cell transplants; surgery to remove the spleen; and biologic and targeted therapies.  Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Cytomegalovirus Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/cytomegalovirusinfections.html,Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus found around the world. It is related to the viruses that cause chickenpox and infectious mononucleosis (mono). Between 50 percent and 80 percent of adults in the United States have had a CMV infection by age 40. Once CMV is in a person's body; it stays there for life.  CMV is spread through close contact with body fluids. Most people with CMV don't get sick and don't know that they've been infected. But infection with the virus can be serious in babies and people with weak immune systems. If a woman gets CMV when she is pregnant; she can pass it on to her baby. Usually the babies do not have health problems. But some babies can develop lifelong disabilities.A blood test can tell whether a person has ever been infected with CMV. Most people with CMV don't need treatment. If you have a weakened immune system; your doctor may prescribe antiviral medicine. Good hygiene; including proper hand washing; may help prevent infections.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning,https://medlineplus.gov/carbonmonoxidepoisoning.html,Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that has no odor or color. But it is very dangerous. It can cause sudden illness and death. CO is found in combustion fumes; such as those made by cars and trucks; lanterns; stoves; gas ranges and heating systems. CO from these fumes can build up in places that don't have a good flow of fresh air.  You can be poisoned by breathing them in.  The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are  Headache Dizziness Weakness Nausea Vomiting Chest pain Confusion  It is often hard to tell if someone has CO poisoning; because the symptoms may be like those of other illnesses. People who are sleeping or intoxicated can die from CO poisoning before they have symptoms. A CO detector can warn you if you have high levels of CO in your home.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Interstitial Lung Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/interstitiallungdiseases.html,Interstitial lung disease is the name for a large group of diseases that inflame or scar the lungs. The inflammation and scarring make it hard to get enough oxygen. The scarring is called pulmonary fibrosis.Breathing in dust or other particles in the air is responsible for some types of interstitial lung diseases. Specific types includeBlack lung disease among coal miners; from inhaling coal dustFarmer's lung; from inhaling farm dustAsbestosis; from inhaling asbestos fibersSiderosis; from inhaling iron from mines or welding fumesSilicosis; from inhaling silica dustOther causes include autoimmune diseases or occupational exposures to molds; gases; or fumes. Some types of interstitial lung disease have no known cause.Treatment depends on the type of exposure and the stage of the disease. It may involve medicines; oxygen therapy; or a lung transplant in severe cases.
Cocaine,https://medlineplus.gov/cocaine.html,Cocaine is a white powder. It can be snorted up the nose or mixed with water and injected with a needle.

You are also at risk for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis; from sharing needles or having unsafe sex. Cocaine is more dangerous when combined with other drugs or alcohol.It is easy to lose control over cocaine use and become addicted. Then; even if you get treatment; it can be hard to stay off the drug. People who stopped using cocaine can still feel strong cravings for the drug; sometimes even years later.NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Valley Fever,https://medlineplus.gov/valleyfever.html,Valley Fever is a disease caused by a fungus (or mold) called Coccidioides. The fungi live in the soil of dry areas like the southwestern U.S. You get it from inhaling the spores of the fungus. The infection cannot spread from person to person.Anyone can get Valley Fever. But it's most common among older adults; especially those 60 and older. People who have recently moved to an area where it occurs are at highest risk for infection. Other people at higher risk includeWorkers in jobs that expose them to soil dust.   These include construction workers; agricultural workers; and military forces doing field training.African Americans and AsiansWomen in their third trimester of pregnancyPeople with weak immune systemsValley Fever is often mild; with no symptoms. If you have symptoms; they may include a flu-like illness; with fever; cough; headache; rash; and muscle aches. Most people get better within several weeks or months. A small number of people may develop a chronic lung or widespread infection.Valley Fever is diagnosed by testing your blood; other body fluids; or tissues. Many people with the acute infection get better without treatment. In some cases; doctors may prescribe antifungal drugs for acute infections. Severe infections require antifungal drugs.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Tailbone Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/tailbonedisorders.html,The tailbone is the small bone at the bottom of your backbone; or spine. Tailbone disorders include tailbone injuries; pain; infections; cysts and tumors.  You rarely break your tailbone. Instead; most injuries cause bruises or pulled ligaments. A backward fall onto a hard surface; such as slipping on ice; is the most common cause of such injuries.   Symptoms of various tailbone disorders include pain in the tailbone area; pain upon sitting; pain or numbness in the arms or legs due to pressure on nerves in the tailbone area; and a mass or growth you can see or feel.
Cochlear Implants,https://medlineplus.gov/cochlearimplants.html,A cochlear implant is a small; complex electronic device that can help to provide a sense of sound. People who are profoundly deaf or severely hard-of-hearing can get help from them. The implant consists of two parts. One part sits on the outside of the body; behind the ear.  A second part is surgically placed under the skin. An implant does not restore normal hearing.  It can help a person understand speech.  Children and adults can benefit from them.National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Frostbite,https://medlineplus.gov/frostbite.html,Frostbite is an injury to the body that is caused by freezing. It most often affects the nose; ears; cheeks; chin; fingers; or toes.

It may feel firm or waxy when you touch it. The area will also feel numb.If you have symptoms of frostbite; seek medical care. But if immediate medical care isn't available; here are steps to take:Get into a warm room as soon as possible.If possible; do not walk on frostbitten feet or toes. Walking increases the damage.Put the affected area in warm - not hot - water.You can also warm the affected area using body heat. For example; use your armpit to warm frostbitten fingers. Don't rub the frostbitten area with snow or massage it at all. This can cause more damage. Don't use a heating pad; heat lamp; or the heat of a stove; fireplace; or radiator for warming. Since frostbite makes an area numb; you could burn it.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Hypothermia,https://medlineplus.gov/hypothermia.html,Cold weather can affect your body in different ways. You can get frostbite; which is an injury to the body that is caused by freezing. Your body can also lose heat faster than you can produce it. That can cause hypothermia; or abnormally low body temperature. It can make you sleepy; confused; and clumsy. Because it happens gradually and affects your thinking; you may not realize you need help. That makes it especially dangerous. A body temperature below 95 F is a medical emergency and can lead to death if not treated promptly. Anyone who spends much time outdoors in cold weather can get hypothermia. You can also get it from being cold and wet; or under cold water for too long. Babies and old people are especially at risk. Babies can get it from sleeping in a cold room.

Symptoms may include a headache or neck pain. You may also have nausea; ringing in your ears; dizziness; or tiredness. You may feel dazed or not your normal self for several days or weeks after the injury. Consult your health care professional if any of your symptoms get worse; or if you have more serious symptoms such asConvulsions or seizuresDrowsiness or inability to wake upA headache that gets worse and does not go awayWeakness; numbness; or decreased coordinationRepeated vomiting or nauseaConfusionSlurred speechLoss of consciousnessTo diagnose a concussion; your health care provider will do a physical exam and will ask about your injury. You will most likely have a neurological exam; which checks your vision; balance; coordination; and reflexes. Your health care provider may also evaluate your memory and thinking. In some cases; you may also have a scan of the brain; such as a CT Scan or an MRI. A scan can check for bleeding or inflammation in the brain; as well as skull fractures.Most people recover fully after a concussion; but it can take some time. Rest is very important after a concussion because it helps the brain to heal. In the very beginning; you may need to limit physical activities or activities that involve a lot of concentration; such as studying; working on the computer; or playing video games. Doing these may cause concussion symptoms (such as headache or tiredness) to come back or get worse. Then when your health care provider says that it is ok; you can start to return to your normal activities slowly.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

The behavior is also not appropriate for the child's age.Warning signs can includeHarming or threatening themselves; other people or petsDamaging or destroying property Lying or stealing Not doing well in school; skipping school Early smoking; drinking or drug use Early sexual activity Frequent tantrums and arguments Consistent hostility toward authority figures  If you see signs of a problem; ask for help. Poor choices can become habits. Kids who have behavior problems are at higher risk for school failure; mental health problems; and even suicide. Classes or family therapy may help parents learn to set and enforce limits. Talk therapy and behavior therapy for your child can also help.
Genital Warts,https://medlineplus.gov/genitalwarts.html,Genital warts are a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The warts are soft; moist; pink; or flesh-colored bumps. You can have one or many of these bumps.  In women; the warts usually occur in or around the vagina; on the cervix or around the anus. In men; genital warts are less common but might occur on the tip of the penis. You can get genital warts during oral; vaginal; or anal sex with an infected partner.  Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces; but does not completely eliminate; the risk of catching or spreading HPV. HPV vaccines may help prevent some of the HPV infections that cause genital warts.Your health care provider usually diagnoses genital warts by seeing them. The warts might disappear on their own. If not; your health care provider can treat or remove them. The virus stays in your body even after treatment; so warts can come back.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Personal Health Records,https://medlineplus.gov/personalhealthrecords.html,You've probably seen your chart at your doctor's office. In fact; you may have charts at several doctors' offices.  If you've been in the hospital; you have a chart there; too. These charts are your medical records. They may be on paper or electronic.

They produce hormones that you can't live without; including sex hormones and cortisol. Cortisol helps you respond to stress and has many other important functions.With adrenal gland disorders; your glands make too much or not enough hormones. In Cushing's syndrome; there's too much cortisol; while with Addison's disease; there is too little. Some people are born unable to make enough cortisol.Causes of adrenal gland disorders includeGenetic mutationsTumors including pheochromocytomasInfectionsA problem in another gland; such as the pituitary; which helps to regulate the adrenal glandCertain medicinesTreatment depends on which problem you have.  Surgery or medicines can treat many adrenal gland disorders.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Hernia,https://medlineplus.gov/hernia.html,A hernia happens when part of an internal organ or tissue bulges through a weak area of muscle. Most hernias are in the abdomen.There are several types of hernias; including Inguinal; in the groin. This is the the most common type. Umbilical; around the belly button Incisional; through a scar Hiatal; a small opening in the diaphragm that allows the upper part of the stomach to move up into the chest. Congenital diaphragmatic; a birth defect that needs surgeryHernias are common. They can affect men; women; and children.

Untreated hernias can cause pain and health problems.
Congenital Heart Defects,https://medlineplus.gov/congenitalheartdefects.html,A congenital heart defect is a problem with the structure of the heart. It is present at birth. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect. The defects can involve the walls of the heart; the valves of the heart; and the arteries and veins near the heart. They can disrupt the normal flow of blood through the heart. The blood flow can slow down; go in the wrong direction or to the wrong place; or be blocked completely.Doctors use a physical exam and special heart tests to diagnose congenital heart defects. They often find severe defects during pregnancy or soon after birth. Signs and symptoms of severe defects in newborns includeRapid breathingCyanosis - a bluish tint to the skin; lips; and fingernailsFatiguePoor blood circulationMany congenital heart defects cause few or no signs and symptoms. They are often not diagnosed until children are older.Many children with congenital heart defects don't need treatment; but others do.

Thalassemia,https://medlineplus.gov/thalassemia.html,Thalassemias are inherited blood disorders. If you have one; your body makes fewer healthy red blood cells and less hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen to the body. That leads to anemia. Thalassemias occur most often among people of Italian; Greek; Middle Eastern; Southern Asian; and African descent.Thalassemias can be mild or severe. Some people have no symptoms or mild anemia. The most common severe type in the United States is called Cooley's anemia. It usually appears during the first two years of life. People with it may have severe anemia; slowed growth and delayed puberty; and problems with the spleen; liver; heart; or bones.Doctors diagnose thalassemias using blood tests. Treatments include blood transfusions and treatment to remove excess iron from the body. If you have mild symptoms or no symptoms; you may not need treatment. In some severe cases; you may need a bone marrow transplant.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
COPD,https://medlineplus.gov/copd.html,COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) makes it hard for you to breathe. The two main types are chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The main cause of COPD is long-term exposure to substances that irritate and damage the lungs. This is usually cigarette smoke. Air pollution; chemical fumes; or dust can also cause it.At first; COPD may cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse; symptoms usually become more severe. They includeA cough that produces a lot of mucusShortness of breath; especially with physical activityWheezingChest tightnessDoctors use lung function tests; imaging tests; and blood tests to diagnose COPD. There is no cure. Treatments may relieve symptoms. They include medicines; oxygen therapy; surgery; or a lung transplant. Quitting smoking is the most important step you can take to treat COPD.

Your body uses minerals for many different jobs; including keeping your bones; muscles; heart; and brain working properly. Minerals are also important for making enzymes and hormones.There are two kinds of minerals: macrominerals and trace minerals. You need larger amounts of macrominerals. They include calcium; phosphorus; magnesium; sodium; potassium; chloride and sulfur. You only need small amounts of trace minerals. They include iron; manganese; copper; iodine; zinc; cobalt; fluoride and selenium. Most people get the amount of minerals they need by eating a wide variety of foods. In some cases; your doctor may recommend a mineral supplement. People who have certain health problems or take some medicines may need to get less of one of the minerals. For example; people with chronic kidney disease need to limit foods that are high in potassium.
Wilson Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/wilsondisease.html,Wilson disease is a rare inherited disorder that prevents your body from getting rid of extra copper.  You need a small amount of copper from food to stay healthy. Too much copper is poisonous.Normally; your liver releases extra copper into bile; a digestive fluid.  With Wilson disease; the copper builds up in your liver; and it releases the copper directly into your bloodstream. This can cause damage to your brain; kidneys; and eyes.Wilson disease is present at birth; but symptoms usually start between ages 5 and 35. It first attacks the liver; the central nervous system or both. The most characteristic sign is a rusty brown ring around the cornea of the eye. A physical exam and laboratory tests can diagnose it.Treatment is with drugs to remove the extra copper from your body.  You need to take medicine and follow a low-copper diet for the rest of your life. Don't eat shellfish or liver; as these foods may contain high levels of copper.  At the beginning of treatment; you'll also need to avoid chocolate; mushrooms; and nuts. Have your drinking water checked for copper content and don't take multivitamins that contain copper.With early detection and proper treatment; you can enjoy good health.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Pulmonary Hypertension,https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryhypertension.html,Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs. It is a serious condition. If you have it; the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your lungs become hard and narrow. Your heart has to work harder to pump the blood through. Over time; your heart weakens and cannot do its job and you can develop heart failure. Symptoms of PH  includeShortness of breath during routine activity; such as climbing two flights of stairsTirednessChest painA racing heartbeatPain on the upper right side of the abdomenDecreased appetiteAs PH worsens; you may find it hard to do any physical activities.There are two main kinds of PH. One runs in families or appears for no known reason. The other kind is related to another condition; usually heart or lung disease. There is no cure for PH. Treatments can control symptoms.  They involve treating the heart or lung disease; medicines; oxygen; and sometimes lung transplantation.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Stem Cells,https://medlineplus.gov/stemcells.html,Stem cells are cells with the potential to develop into many different types of cells in the body. They serve as a repair system for the body. There are two main types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells.  Stem cells are different from other cells in the body in three ways:They can divide and renew themselves over a long timeThey are unspecialized; so they cannot do specific functions in the bodyThey have the potential to become specialized cells; such as muscle cells; blood cells; and brain cellsDoctors and scientists are excited about stem cells because they could help in many different areas of health and medical research.  Studying stem cells may help explain how serious conditions such as birth defects and cancer come about. Stem cells may one day be used to make cells and tissues for therapy of many diseases. Examples include Parkinson's disease; Alzheimer's disease; spinal cord injury; heart disease; diabetes; and arthritis.NIH: National Institutes of Health
Carbohydrates,https://medlineplus.gov/carbohydrates.html,Carbohydrates are one of the main types of nutrients.  They are the most important source of energy for your body. Your digestive system changes carbohydrates into glucose (blood sugar). Your body  uses this sugar for energy for your cells; tissues and organs. It stores any extra sugar in your liver and muscles for when it is needed.Carbohydrates are called simple or complex; depending on their chemical structure. Simple carbohydrates include sugars found naturally in foods such as fruits; vegetables; milk; and milk products. They also include sugars added during food processing and refining. Complex carbohydrates include whole grain breads and cereals; starchy vegetables and legumes. Many of the complex carbohydrates are good sources of fiber.For a healthy diet; limit the amount of added sugar that you eat and choose whole grains over refined grains.
Corneal Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/cornealdisorders.html,Your cornea is the outermost layer of your eye. It is clear and shaped like a dome. The cornea helps to shield the rest of the eye from germs; dust; and other harmful matter. It also helps your eye to focus. If you wear contact lenses; they float on top of your corneas. Problems with the cornea includeRefractive errorsAllergiesInfectionsInjuriesDystrophies - conditions in which parts of the cornea lose clarity due to a buildup of cloudy materialTreatments of corneal disorders include medicines; corneal transplantation; and corneal laser surgery. NIH: National Eye Institute
Corns and Calluses,https://medlineplus.gov/cornsandcalluses.html,Corns and calluses are caused by pressure or friction on your skin. They often appear on feet where the bony parts of your feet rub against your shoes. Corns usually appear on the tops or sides of toes while calluses form on the soles of feet. Calluses also can appear on hands or other areas that are rubbed or pressed. Wearing shoes that fit better or using non-medicated pads may help. While bathing; gently rub the corn or callus with a washcloth or pumice stone to help reduce the size. To avoid infection; do not try to shave off the corn or callus. See your doctor; especially if you have diabetes or circulation problems. NIH: National Institute on Aging
Coronary Artery Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/coronaryarterydisease.html,Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease. It is the leading cause of death in the United States in both men and women.CAD happens when the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material; called plaque; on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows; less blood can flow through the arteries. As a result; the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack.  Most heart attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the hearts' blood supply; causing permanent heart damage.  Over time; CAD can also weaken the heart muscle and contribute to heart failure and arrhythmias. Heart failure means the heart can't pump blood well to the rest of the body. Arrhythmias are changes in the normal beating rhythm of the heart.  NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/coronaryarterybypasssurgery.html,In coronary artery disease (CAD); the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to your heart muscle grow hardened and narrowed. You may try treatments such as lifestyle changes; medicines; and angioplasty; a procedure to open the arteries.  If these treatments don't help; you may need coronary artery bypass surgery.The surgery creates a new path for blood to flow to the heart.  The surgeon takes a healthy piece of vein from the leg or artery from the chest or wrist.  Then the surgeon attaches it to the coronary artery; just above and below the narrowed area or blockage. This allows blood to bypass (get around) the blockage. Sometimes people need more than one bypass.The results of the surgery usually are excellent. Many people remain symptom-free for many years. You may need surgery again if blockages form in the grafted arteries or veins or in arteries that weren't blocked before.  Lifestyle changes and medicines may help prevent arteries from becoming clogged again.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

Coronavirus Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/coronavirusinfections.html,Coronaviruses are common viruses that most people get some time in their life. They are common throughout the world; and they can infect people and animals. Several different coronaviruses can infect people and make them sick. They usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory illness. But; some coronaviruses can cause severe illness.Coronaviruses probably spread through the air by coughing or sneezing; or by close personal contact. If you get infected; symptoms may includeRunny noseCoughSore throatFeverYou may be able to reduce your risk of infection by washing your hands often with soap and water; not touching your eyes; nose; or mouth; and avoiding close contact with people who are sick. There is no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection. There are no specific treatments. You can relieve symptoms with pain and fever medicines and rest.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Steroids,https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html,You may have heard of anabolic steroids; which can have harmful effects. But there's another type of steroid - sometimes called a corticosteroid - that treats a variety of problems. These steroids are similar to hormones that your adrenal glands make to fight stress associated with illnesses and injuries. They reduce inflammation and affect the immune system. You may need to take corticosteroids to treatArthritisAsthmaAutoimmune diseases such as lupus and multiple sclerosisSkin conditions such as eczema and rashesSome kinds of cancerSteroids are strong medicines; and they can have side effects; including weakened bones and cataracts. Because of this; you usually take them for as short a time as possible.
Cosmetic Dentistry,https://medlineplus.gov/cosmeticdentistry.html,If you have stained; broken or uneven teeth; cosmetic dentistry can help. Cosmetic dentistry is different from orthodontic treatment; which can straighten your teeth with braces or other devices.Cosmetic dental procedures includeBleaching to make teeth whiterRepairing chips or rough spots with fillings that match your teeth Filling cavities with tooth-colored materials Reshaping teeth that don't match the othersClosing gaps between teeth Covering broken teeth with porcelain crowns
Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/plasticandcosmeticsurgery.html,Surgeons can reshape the appearance of body parts through cosmetic surgery.  Some of the most common body parts people want to improve through surgery include   Breasts: Increase or reduce the size of breasts or reshape sagging breasts   Ears: Reduce the size of large ears or set protruding ears back closer to the head  Eyes: Correct drooping upper eyelids or remove puffy bags below the eyes  Face: Remove facial wrinkles; creases or acne scars  Hair: Fill in balding areas with one's own hair  Nose: Change the shape of the nose   Tummy:  Flatten the abdomen
Cosmetics,https://medlineplus.gov/cosmetics.html,Cosmetics are products you apply to your body to clean it; make it more attractive; or change the way it looks.  They includeHair dyes Makeup Perfumes Skin-care creams Cosmetics that treat or prevent diseases are also drugs. Products such as dandruff shampoo; fluoride toothpaste; and antiperspirant deodorant are both cosmetics and drugs. A good way to tell if you're buying a cosmetic that is also a drug is to see if the first ingredient listed is an "active ingredient." The active ingredient is the chemical that makes the product effective. The manufacturer must have proof that it's safe for its intended use.Cosmetics can cause allergic reactions. The first sign is often red and irritated skin. Fragrances and preservatives are the most common causes of skin problems.To find out all the ingredients in a cosmetic you use; check the container. Manufacturers are required to list them. Labels such as "natural" and "hypoallergenic" have no official meaning. Companies can use them to mean whatever they want. Food and Drug Administration
Cartilage Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/cartilagedisorders.html,Cartilage is the tough but flexible tissue that covers the ends of your bones at a joint. It also gives shape and support to other parts of your body; such as your ears; nose and windpipe. Healthy cartilage helps you move by allowing your bones to glide over each other. It also protects bones by preventing them from rubbing against each other. Injured; inflamed; or damaged cartilage can cause symptoms such as pain and limited movement. It can also lead to joint damage and deformity. Causes of cartilage problems include Tears and injuries; such as sports injuriesGenetic factors Other disorders; such as some types of arthritisOsteoarthritis results from breakdown of cartilage.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Cough,https://medlineplus.gov/cough.html,Coughing is a reflex that keeps your throat and airways clear.  Although it can be annoying; coughing helps your body heal or protect itself. Coughs can be either acute or chronic.  Acute coughs begin suddenly and usually last no more than 2 to 3 weeks.  Acute coughs are the kind you most often get with a cold; flu; or acute bronchitis.  Chronic coughs last longer than 2 to 3 weeks.  Causes of chronic cough includeChronic bronchitisAsthmaAllergiesCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) SmokingThroat disorders; such as croup in young childrenSome medicines Water can help ease your cough - whether you drink it or add it to the air with a steamy shower or vaporizer. If you have a cold or the flu; antihistamines may work better than non-prescription cough medicines.   Children under four should not have cough medicine.  For children over four; use caution and read labels carefully.
Cold and Cough Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/coldandcoughmedicines.html,Sneezing; sore throat; a stuffy nose; coughing -- everyone knows the symptoms of the common cold. It is probably the most common illness. Every year; adults get about 2-3 colds; and children get even more.What can you do for your cold or cough symptoms? Besides drinking lots of fluids and getting plenty of rest; you may decide to take medicines. There are lots of different cold and cough medicines; and they do different things.Nasal decongestants - unclog a stuffy noseCough suppressants - quiet a coughExpectorants - loosen mucus so you can cough it up Antihistamines - stop runny noses and sneezingPain relievers - ease fever; headaches; and minor aches and painsBefore taking these medicines; read the labels carefully. Many cold and cough medicines contain the same active ingredients. For example; taking too much of certain pain relievers can lead to serious injury. Do not give cold or cough medicines to children under four; and don't give aspirin to children. Finally; antibiotics won't help a cold.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Viral Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/viralinfections.html,Viruses are very tiny germs. They are made of genetic material inside of a protein coating. Viruses cause familiar infectious diseases such as the common cold; flu and warts. They also cause severe illnesses such as HIV/AIDS; smallpox; and Ebola.Viruses are like hijackers. They invade living; normal cells and use those cells to multiply and produce other viruses like themselves. This can kill; damage; or change the cells and make you sick. Different viruses attack certain cells in your body such as your liver; respiratory system; or blood.When you get a virus; you may not always get sick from it. Your immune system may be able to fight it off.For most viral infections; treatments can only help with symptoms while you wait for your immune system to fight off the virus. Antibiotics do not work for viral infections. There are antiviral medicines to treat some viral infections. Vaccines can help prevent you from getting many viral diseases.
CPR,https://medlineplus.gov/cpr.html,When someone's blood flow or breathing stops; seconds count. Permanent brain damage or death can happen quickly. If you know how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); you could save a life. CPR is an emergency procedure for a person whose heart has stopped or is no longer breathing.  CPR can maintain circulation and breathing until emergency medical help  arrives.Even if you haven't had training; you can do "hands-only" CPR for a teen or adult whose heart has stopped beating ("hands-only" CPR isn't recommended for children).  "Hands-only" CPR uses chest compressions to keep blood circulating until emergency help arrives. If you've had training; you can use chest compressions; clear the airway; and do rescue breathing. Rescue breathing helps get oxygen to the lungs for a person who has stopped breathing.  To keep your skills up; you should repeat the training every two years.
Lice,https://medlineplus.gov/lice.html,Lice are parasitic insects that can be found on people's heads and bodies. They survive by feeding on human blood.

A deep vein thrombosis can break loose and cause a serious problem in the lung;  called a pulmonary embolism.Sitting still for a long time can make you more likely to get a DVT. Some medicines and disorders that increase your risk for blood clots can also lead to DVTs. Common symptoms are  Warmth and tenderness over the vein  Pain or swelling in the part of the body affected  Skin redness Treatment includes medicines to ease pain and inflammation; break up clots and keep new clots from forming. Keeping the affected area raised and applying moist heat can also help. If you are taking a long car or plane trip; take a break; walk or stretch your legs and drink plenty of liquids.
Pacemakers and Implantable Defibrillators,https://medlineplus.gov/pacemakersandimplantabledefibrillators.html,An arrhythmia is any disorder of your heart rate or rhythm. It means that your heart beats too quickly; too slowly; or with an irregular pattern. Most arrhythmias result from problems in the electrical system of the heart. If your arrhythmia is serious; you may need a cardiac pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).  They are devices that are implanted in your chest or abdomen.A pacemaker helps control abnormal heart rhythms. It uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. It can speed up a slow heart rhythm; control a fast heart rhythm; and coordinate the chambers of the heart.An ICD monitors heart rhythms. If it senses dangerous rhythms; it delivers shocks. This treatment is called defibrillation. An ICD can help control life-threatening arrhythmias; especially those that can cause sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Most new ICDs can act as both a pacemaker and a defibrillator. Many ICDs also record the heart's electrical patterns when there is an abnormal heartbeat. This can help the doctor plan future treatment.Getting a pacemaker or ICD requires minor surgery. You usually need to stay in the hospital for a day or two; so your doctor can make sure that the device is working well. You will probably be back to your normal activities within a few days.
Osteoarthritis,https://medlineplus.gov/osteoarthritis.html,Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It causes pain; swelling; and reduced motion in your joints.

Cartilage is the slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones in a joint. Healthy cartilage absorbs the shock of movement. When you lose cartilage; your bones rub together. Over time; this rubbing can permanently damage the joint.Risk factors for osteoarthritis include Being overweight Getting older Injuring a joint No single test can diagnose osteoarthritis. Most doctors use several methods; including medical history; a physical exam; x-rays; or lab tests.Treatments include exercise; medicines; and sometimes surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Degenerative Nerve Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/degenerativenervediseases.html,Degenerative nerve diseases affect many of your body's activities; such as balance; movement; talking; breathing; and heart function.

Sometimes the cause is not known.Degenerative nerve diseases include Alzheimer's disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosisFriedreich's ataxia Huntington's disease Lewy body diseaseParkinson's disease  Spinal muscular atrophyDegenerative nerve diseases can be serious or life-threatening. It depends on the type. Most of them have no cure. Treatments may help improve symptoms; relieve pain; and increase mobility.
Dehydration,https://medlineplus.gov/dehydration.html,When you're dehydrated; your body doesn't have enough fluid and electrolytes to work properly. An average person on an average day needs about 3 quarts of water. But if you're out in the hot sun or are exercising a lot; you need a lot more than that. You can also become dehydrated if you are vomiting; have diarrhea; or are sweating a lot. People who are elderly; very young; taking certain medications; or have a chronic illness have a greater risk.Signs of dehydration in adults includeBeing thirstyUrinating less often than usualDark-colored urineDry skinFeeling tiredDizziness and faintingSigns of dehydration in babies and young children include a dry mouth and tongue; crying without tears; no wet diapers for 3 hours or more; a high fever and being unusually sleepy or drowsy.If you think you're dehydrated; drink small amounts of water over a period of time. Drinking too much all at once can overload your stomach and make you throw up. If you are exercising in the heat and losing a lot of minerals in sweat; sports drinks can be helpful. Avoid any drinks that have caffeine.NIH: National Institutes of Health
Delirium,https://medlineplus.gov/delirium.html,Delirium is a condition that features rapidly changing mental states.  It causes confusion and changes in behavior.  Besides falling in and out of consciousness; there may be problems withAttention and awarenessThinking and memoryEmotionMuscle controlSleeping and wakingCauses of delirium include medications; poisoning; serious illnesses or infections; and severe pain. It can also be part of some mental illnesses or dementia.Delirium and dementia have similar symptoms; so it can be hard to tell them apart.  They can also occur together. Delirium starts suddenly and can cause hallucinations. The symptoms may get better or worse; and can last for hours or weeks.  On the other hand; dementia develops slowly and does not cause hallucinations. The symptoms are stable; and may last for months or years. Delirium tremens is a serious type of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.  It usually happens to people who stop drinking after years of alcohol abuse.People with delirium often; though not always; make a full recovery after their underlying illness is treated.
Childbirth,https://medlineplus.gov/childbirth.html,When you are ready to have your baby; you'll go through labor.  Labor is the process of giving birth. Signs that you might be going into labor includeContractions that are regular then start to come closer togetherLeaking fluid or bleeding from the vaginaLow; dull backacheAbdominal crampsCall your health care provider if you have any of these signs; even if it is before your due date. Preterm labor can start before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy.Labor happens in three stages. The first stage begins with contractions. It continues until your cervix has become thinner and dilated (stretched) to about 4 inches wide. The second stage is the active stage; in which you begin to push downward. Crowning is when your baby's scalp comes into view. Shortly afterward; your baby is born. In the third stage; you deliver the placenta. The placenta is the organ that supplied food and oxygen to your baby during pregnancy.Mothers and babies are monitored closely during labor. Most women are able to have a baby through normal vaginal delivery. If there are complications; the baby may need to be delivered surgically by a Cesarean section.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Dementia,https://medlineplus.gov/dementia.html,Dementia is the name for a group of symptoms caused by disorders that affect the brain. It is not a specific disease. People with dementia may not be able to think well enough to do normal activities; such as getting dressed or eating. They may lose their ability to solve problems or control their emotions. Their personalities may change. They may become agitated or see things that are not there. Memory loss is a common symptom of dementia. However; memory loss by itself does not mean you have dementia. People with dementia have serious problems with two or more brain functions; such as memory and language. Although dementia is common in very elderly people; it is not part of normal aging.Many different diseases can cause dementia; including Alzheimer's disease and stroke. Drugs are available to treat some of these diseases. While these drugs cannot cure dementia or repair brain damage; they may improve symptoms or slow down the disease.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Lewy Body Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/lewybodydisease.html,Lewy body disease is one of the most common causes of dementia in the elderly. Dementia is the loss of mental functions severe enough to  affect normal activities and relationships. Lewy body disease happens when  abnormal structures; called Lewy bodies; build up in areas of the brain. The disease may cause a wide range of symptoms; includingChanges in alertness and attentionHallucinationsProblems with movement and postureMuscle stiffnessConfusionLoss of memoryLewy body disease can be hard to diagnose; because Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease cause similar symptoms. Scientists  think that Lewy body disease might be related to these diseases; or that they sometimes happen together.Lewy body disease usually begins between the ages of 50 and  85. The disease gets worse over time. There is no cure. Treatment focuses on drugs to help symptoms. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Dengue,https://medlineplus.gov/dengue.html,Dengue is an infection caused by a virus. You can get it if an infected mosquito bites you. Dengue does not spread from person to person.

Symptoms include a high fever; headaches; joint and muscle pain; vomiting; and a rash. In some cases; dengue turns into dengue hemorrhagic fever; which causes bleeding from your nose; gums; or under your skin. It can also become dengue shock syndrome; which causes massive bleeding and shock. These forms of dengue are life-threatening.There is no specific treatment. Most people with dengue recover within 2 weeks. Until then; drinking lots of fluids; resting and taking non-aspirin fever-reducing medicines might help. People with the more severe forms of dengue usually need to go to the hospital and get fluids.To lower your risk when traveling to areas where dengue is foundWear insect repellent with DEET Wear clothes that cover your arms; legs and feet Close unscreened doors and windows  NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

If you feel nauseated; sluggish or shaky; seek emergency care.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Diabetes in Children and Teens,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetesinchildrenandteens.html,Until recently; the common type of diabetes in children and teens was type 1. It was called juvenile diabetes. With Type 1 diabetes; the pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose;or sugar; get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin; too much sugar stays in the blood.Now younger people are also getting type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes. But now it is becoming more common in children and teens; due to more obesity. With Type 2 diabetes; the body does not make or use insulin well.Children have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if they  are overweight or have obesity; have a family history of diabetes; or are not active. Children who are African American; Hispanic; Native American/Alaska Native; Asian American; or Pacific Islander also have a higher risk. To lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in childrenHave them maintain a healthy weightBe sure they are physically activeHave them eat smaller portions of healthy foodsLimit time with the TV; computer; and videoChildren and teens with type 1 diabetes may need to take insulin. Type 2 diabetes may be  controlled with diet and exercise. If not; patients will need to take oral diabetes medicines or insulin. A blood test called the A1C can check on how you are managing your diabetes.
Diabetes Insipidus,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetesinsipidus.html,Diabetes insipidus (DI) causes frequent urination. You become extremely thirsty; so you drink. Then you urinate. This cycle can keep you from sleeping or even make you wet the bed. Your body produces lots of urine that is almost all water.DI is different from diabetes mellitus (DM); which involves insulin problems and high blood sugar. The symptoms can be similar. However; DI is related to how your kidneys handle fluids. It's much less common than DM. Urine and blood tests can show which one you have.Usually; DI is caused by a problem with your pituitary gland or your kidneys. Treatment depends on the cause of the problem.  Medicines can often help.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Diabetes Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetesmedicines.html,Diabetes means your blood glucose; or blood sugar; levels are too high. If you can't control your diabetes with wise food choices and physical activity; you may need diabetes medicines. The kind of medicine you take depends on your type of diabetes; your schedule; and your other health conditions. With type 1 diabetes; your pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin; too much glucose stays in your blood. If you have type 1 diabetes; you will need to take insulin. Type 2 diabetes; the most common type; can start when the body doesn't use insulin as it should. If your body can't keep up with the need for insulin; you may need to take pills.  Along with meal planning and physical activity; diabetes pills help people with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes keep their blood glucose levels on target. Several kinds of pills are available. Each works in a different way. Many people take two or three kinds of pills. Some people take combination pills. Combination pills contain two kinds of diabetes medicine in one tablet. Some people take pills and insulin.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Tremors are a type of dyskinesia. Nerve diseases cause many movement disorders; such as Parkinson's disease. Other causes include injuries; autoimmune diseases; infections and certain medicines. Many movement disorders are inherited; which means they run in families.Treatment varies by disorder. Medicine can cure some disorders. Others get better when an underlying disease is treated. Often; however; there is no cure. In that case; the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms and relieve pain.
Learning Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/learningdisorders.html,Learning disorders affect how a person understands; remembers and responds to new information. People with learning disorders may have problems  Listening or paying attention Speaking Reading  or writing Doing math  Although learning disorders occur in very young children; they are usually not recognized until the child reaches school age. About one-third of children who have learning disabilities also have ADHD; which makes it hard to focus.  Evaluation and testing by a trained professional can help identify a learning disorder. The next step is special education; which involves helping your child in the areas where he or she needs the most help. Sometimes tutors or speech or language therapists also work with the children.  Learning disorders do not go away; but strategies to work around them can make them less of a problem. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Period Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/periodpain.html,What are painful periods?Menstruation; or period; is normal vaginal bleeding that happens as part of a woman's monthly cycle. Many women have painful periods; also called dysmenorrhea. The pain is most often menstrual cramps; which are a throbbing; cramping pain in your lower abdomen. You may also have other symptoms; such as lower back pain; nausea; diarrhea; and headaches. Period pain is not the same as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). PMS causes many different symptoms; including weight gain; bloating; irritability; and fatigue. PMS often starts one to two weeks before your period starts.What causes painful periods?There are two types of dysmenorrhea: primary and secondary. Each type has different causes.Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common kind of period pain. It is period pain that is not caused by another condition. The cause is usually having too many prostaglandins; which are chemicals that your uterus makes. These chemicals make the muscles of your uterus tighten and relax; and this causes the cramps.The pain can start a day or two before your period. It normally lasts for a few days; though in some women it can last longer.You usually first start having period pain when you are younger; just after you begin getting periods. Often; as you get older; you have less pain. The pain may also get better after you have given birth.Secondary dysmenorrhea often starts later in life. It is caused by conditions that affect your uterus or other reproductive organs; such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids. This kind of pain often gets worse over time. It may begin before your period starts; and continue after your period ends.What can I do about period pain?To help ease your period pain; you can tryUsing a heating pad or hot water bottle on your lower abdomenGetting some exerciseTaking a hot bathDoing relaxation techniques; including yoga and meditationYou might also try taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs include ibuprofen and naproxen. Besides relieving pain; NSAIDs reduce the amount of prostaglandins that your uterus makes; and lessen their effects.  This helps to lessen the cramps. You can take NSAIDs when you first have symptoms; or when your period starts. You can keep taking them for a few days. You should not take NSAIDS if you have ulcers or other stomach problems; bleeding problems; or liver disease. You should also not take them if you are allergic to aspirin. Always check with your health care provider if you are not sure whether or not you should take NSAIDs.It may also help to get enough rest and avoid using alcohol and tobacco.When should I get medical help for my period pain?For many women; some pain during your period is normal. However; you should contact your health care provider ifNSAIDs and self-care measures don't help; and the pain interferes with your lifeYour cramps suddenly get worseYou are over 25 and you get severe cramps for the first timeYou have a fever with your period painYou have the pain even when you are not getting your periodHow is the cause of severe period pain diagnosed?To diagnose severe period pain; your health care provider will ask you about your medical history and do a pelvic exam. You may also have an ultrasound or other imaging test. If your health care provider thinks you have secondary dysmenorrhea; you might have laparoscopy. It is a surgery that that lets your health care provider look inside your body.What are treatments for severe period pain?If your period pain is primary dysmenorrhea and you need medical treatment; your health care provider might suggest using hormonal birth control; such as the pill; patch; ring; or IUD. Another treatment option might be prescription pain relievers.If you have secondary dysmenorrhea; your treatment depends upon the condition that is causing the problem. In some cases; you may need surgery.
Taste and Smell Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/tasteandsmelldisorders.html,Our senses of taste and smell give us great pleasure. Taste helps us enjoy food and beverages.

They make us want to eat; ensuring we get the nutrition we need. People with taste disorders may taste things that aren't there; may not be able to tell the difference in tastes; or can't taste at all. People with smell disorders may lose their sense of smell; or things may smell different.  A smell they once enjoyed may now smell bad to them. Many illnesses and injuries can cause taste and smell disorders; including colds and head injuries. Some drugs can also affect taste and smell. Most people lose some ability to taste and smell as they get older. Treatment varies; depending on the problem and its cause. NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders

Ear Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eardisorders.html,Your ear has three main parts: outer; middle and inner. You use all of them in hearing. Sound waves come in through your outer ear. They reach your middle ear; where they make your eardrum vibrate. The vibrations are transmitted through three tiny bones; called ossicles; in your middle ear. The vibrations travel to your inner ear; a snail-shaped organ. The inner ear makes the nerve impulses that are sent to the brain. Your brain recognizes them as sounds. The inner ear also controls balance.A variety of conditions may affect your hearing or balance:Ear infections are the most common illness in infants and young children.Tinnitus; a roaring in your ears; can be the result of loud noises; medicines or a variety of other causes.Meniere's disease may be the result of fluid problems in your inner ear; its symptoms include tinnitus and dizziness.Ear barotrauma is an injury to your ear because of changes in barometric (air) or water pressure.Some ear disorders can result in hearing disorders and deafness.
Ear Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/earinfections.html,Ear infections are the most common reason parents bring their child to a doctor. Three out of four children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday.  Adults can also get ear infections; but they are less common.The infection usually affects the middle ear and is called otitis media. The tubes inside the ears become clogged with fluid and mucus. This can affect hearing; because sound cannot get through all that fluid.If your child isn't old enough to say "My ear hurts;" here are a few things to look forTugging at earsCrying more than usualFluid draining from the earTrouble sleepingBalance difficultiesHearing problemsYour health care provider will diagnose an ear infection by looking inside the ear with an instrument called an otoscope.Often; ear infections go away on their own. Your health care provider may recommend pain relievers. Severe infections and infections in young babies may require antibiotics. Children who get infections often may need surgery to place small tubes inside their ears. The tubes relieve pressure in the ears so that the child can hear again.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Earthquakes,https://medlineplus.gov/earthquakes.html,An earthquake happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another.  Earthquakes strike suddenly; violently; and without warning at any time of the day or night. If an earthquake occurs in a populated area; it may cause property damage; injuries; and even deaths.

Symptoms usually includeFeverHeadacheJoint and muscle achesWeaknessDiarrheaVomitingStomach painLack of appetiteOther symptoms including rash; red eyes; and internal and external bleeding; may also occur.The early symptoms of Ebola are similar to other; more common; diseases. This makes it difficult to diagnose Ebola in someone who has been infected for only a few days. However; if a person has the early symptoms of Ebola and there is reason to suspect Ebola; the patient should be isolated. It is also important to notify public health professionals.  Lab tests can confirm whether the patient has Ebola.There is no cure for Ebola. Treatment involves supportive care such as fluids; oxygen; and treatment of complications. Some people who get Ebola are able to recover; but many do not.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Rh factor is inherited though genes.When you're pregnant; blood from your baby can cross into your bloodstream; especially during delivery. If you're Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive; your body will react to the baby's blood as a foreign substance.  It will create antibodies (proteins) against the baby's blood. These antibodies usually don't cause problems during a first pregnancy.But Rh incompatibility may cause problems in later pregnancies; if the baby is Rh-positive. This is because the antibodies stay in your body once they have formed.  The antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells.  The baby could get Rh disease; a serious condition that can cause a serious type of anemia.Blood tests can tell whether you have Rh factor and whether your body has made antibodies. Injections of a medicine called Rh immune globulin can keep your body from making Rh antibodies. It helps prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility.  If treatment is needed for the baby; it can include supplements to help the body to make red blood cells and blood transfusions.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

Improve your mental health and mood.  During exercise; your body releases chemicals that can improve your mood and make you feel more relaxed. This can help you deal with stress and reduce your risk of depression. Help keep your thinking; learning; and judgment skills sharp as you age.  Exercise stimulates your body to release proteins and other chemicals that improve the structure and function of your brain. Strengthen your bones and muscles.  Regular exercise can help kids and teens build strong bones. Later in life; it can also slow the loss of bone density that comes with age. Doing muscle-strengthening activities can help you increase or maintain your muscle mass and strength. Reduce your risk of some cancers;  including colon; breast ; uterine; and lung cancer. Reduce your risk of falls.  For older adults; research shows that doing balance and muscle-strengthening activities in addition to moderate-intensity aerobic activity can help reduce your risk of falling. Improve your sleep.  Exercise can help you to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. Improve your sexual health.  Regular exercise may lower the risk of erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. For those who already have ED; exercise may help improve their sexual function. In women; exercise may increase sexual arousal. Increase your chances of living longer.  Studies show that physical activity can reduce your risk of dying early from the leading causes of death; like heart disease and some cancers. How can I make exercise a part of my regular routine?Make everyday activities more active. Even small changes can help. You can take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk down the hall to a coworker's office instead of sending an email. Wash the car yourself. Park further away from your destination. Be active with friends and family. Having a workout partner may make you more likely to enjoy exercise. You can also plan social activities that involve exercise. You might also consider joining an exercise group or class; such as a dance class; hiking club; or volleyball team. Keep track of your progress. Keeping a log of your activity or using a fitness tracker may help you set goals and stay motivated. Make exercise more fun. Try listening to music or watching TV while you exercise. Also; mix things up a little bit - if you stick with just one type of exercise; you might get bored. Try doing a combination of activities. Find activities that you can do even when the weather is bad.You can walk in a mall; climb stairs; or work out in a gym even if the weather stops you from exercising outside.
Exercise for Children,https://medlineplus.gov/exerciseforchildren.html,Like adults; kids need exercise. Most children need at least an hour of physical activity every day. Regular exercise has many benefits for children. It can help themFeel less stressedFeel better about themselvesFeel more ready to learn in schoolKeep a healthy weightBuild and keep healthy bones; muscles and jointsSleep better at nightAs kids spend more time watching TV; they spend less time running and playing. Parents should limit TV; video game and computer time.  Parents can set a good example by being active themselves.  Exercising together can be fun for everyone.  Competitive sports can help kids stay fit. Walking or biking to school; dancing; bowling and yoga are some other ways for kids to get exercise.
Exercise for Seniors,https://medlineplus.gov/exerciseforseniors.html,Exercise and physical activity are good for just about everyone; including older adults. There are four main types and each type is different. Doing them all will give you more benefits.Endurance; or aerobic; activities increase your breathing and heart rate. Brisk walking or jogging; dancing; swimming; and biking are examples.Strength exercises make your muscles stronger. Lifting weights or using a resistance band can build strength.Balance exercises help prevent fallsFlexibility exercises stretch your muscles and can help your body stay limberIf you have not been active; you can start slowly and work up to your goal. How much exercise you need depends on your age and health. Check with your health care provider on what is right for you.NIH: National Institute on Aging
How Much Exercise Do I Need?,https://medlineplus.gov/howmuchexercisedoineed.html,Regular exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health. It has many benefits; including improving your overall health and fitness; and reducing your risk for many chronic diseases. To get the most benefit; the recommendations for how much exercise you need are:For adults:Try to get at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity on most days.Aerobic activities include walking fast; jogging; swimming; and bikingExercise at a moderate intensity. One way to check this is to make sure that you can say a few words in a row while exercising. But you should not be able to sing - that would mean that you are not exercising hard enough.You can break your aerobic exercise into segments of ten minutes or moreAlso; do strengthening activities twice per week.Strengthening activities include lifting weights; working with exercise bands; and doing sit-ups and pushupsChoose activities that work all the different parts of the body - your legs; hips; back; chest; stomach; shoulders; and arms. You should repeat exercises for each muscle group 8 to 12 times per session.For children and teens:Get 60 minutes or more of physical activity every day. Most of it should be moderate-intensity aerobic activity.Activities should vary and be a good fit for the child's age and physical developmentModerate-intensity aerobic activities include walking; running; skipping; playing on the playground; playing basketball; and bikingAlso; try to get each of these at least 3 days a week: vigorous-intensity aerobic activity; muscle-strengthening activity; and bone-strengthening activity.Vigorous-intensity aerobic activities include running; doing jumping jacks; and fast swimmingMuscle-strengthening exercise includes playing on playground equipment; playing tug-of-war; and doing pushups and pull-upsBone-strengthening activities include hopping; skipping; doing jumping jacks; playing volleyball; and working with resistance bandsOther groups:Seniors; pregnant women; and people who have special health needs should check with their health care provider on how much exercise they should get and what types of exercises they should do.People who are trying to lose weight may need to get more exercise. They also need to adjust their diet; so they are burning more calories than they eat and drink.If you have been inactive; you may need to start slowly. You can keep adding more gradually. The more you can do; the better. But try not to feel overwhelmed; and do what you can. Getting some exercise is always better than getting none.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Eye Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/eyecancer.html,Cancer of the eye is uncommon. It can affect the outer parts of the eye; such as the eyelid; which are made up of muscles; skin and nerves. If the cancer starts inside the eyeball it's called intraocular cancer. The most common intraocular cancers in adults are melanoma and lymphoma. The most common eye cancer in children is retinoblastoma; which starts in the cells of the retina.  Cancer can also spread to the eye from other parts of the body. Treatment for eye cancer varies by the type and by how advanced it is. It may include surgery; radiation therapy; freezing or heat therapy; or laser therapy.
Eye Care,https://medlineplus.gov/eyecare.html,Your eyes are an important part of your health. Most people rely on their eyes to see and make sense of the world around them. But some eye diseases can lead to vision loss; so it is important to identify and treat eye diseases as early as possible. You should get your eyes checked as often as your health care provider recommends it; or if you have any new vision problems. And just as it is important to keep your body healthy; you also need to keep your eyes healthy.Eye Care TipsThere are things you can do to help keep your eyes healthy and make sure you are seeing your best:Eat a healthy; balanced diet. Your diet should include plenty or fruits and vegetables; especially deep yellow and green leafy vegetables. Eating fish high in omega-3 fatty acids; such as salmon; tuna; and halibut can also help your eyes.Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk of developing diabetes. Having diabetes puts you at higher risk of getting diabetic retinopathy or glaucoma.Get regular exercise. Exercise may help to prevent or control diabetes; high blood pressure; and high cholesterol. These diseases can lead to some eye or vision problems. So if you exercise regularly; you can lower your risk of getting these eye and vision problems.Wear sunglasses. Sun exposure can damage your eyes and raise your risk of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. Protect your eyes by using sunglasses that block out 99 to 100 percent of both UV-A and UV-B radiation.Wear protective eye wear. To prevent eye injuries; you need eye protection when playing certain sports; working in jobs such as factory work and construction; and doing repairs or projects in your home.Avoid smoking. Smoking increases the risk of developing age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts and can damage the optic nerve.Know your family health history. Some eye diseases are inherited; so it is important to find out whether anyone in your family has had them. This can help you determine if you are at higher risk of developing an eye disease.Know your other risk factors. As you get older; you are at higher risk of developing age-related eye diseases and conditions. It is important to know you risk factors because you may be able to lower your risk by changing some behaviors.If you wear contacts; take steps to prevent eye infections. Wash your hands well before you put in or take out your contact lenses. Also follow the instructions on how to properly clean them; and replace them when needed.Give your eyes a rest. If you spend a lot of time using a computer; you can forget to blink your eyes and your eyes can get tired. To reduce eyestrain; try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes; look away about 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds.Eye Tests and ExamsEveryone needs to have their eyesight tested to check for vision and eye problems. Children usually have vision screening in school or at their health care provider's office during a checkup. Adults may also get vision screenings during their checkups. But many adults need more than a vision screening. They need a comprehensive dilated eye exam.Getting comprehensive dilated eye exams is especially important because some eye diseases may not have warning signs. The exams are the only way to detect these diseases in their early stages; when they are easier to treat.The exam includes several tests:A visual field test to measure your side (peripheral) vision. A loss of peripheral vision may be a sign of glaucoma.A visual acuity test; where you read an eye chart about 20 feet away; to check on how well you see at various distancesTonometry; which measures your eye's interior pressure. It helps to detect glaucoma.Dilation; which involves getting eye drops that dilate (widen) your pupils. This allows more light to enter the eye. Your eye care provider examines your eyes using a special magnifying lens. This provides a clear view of important tissues at the back of your eye; including the retina; macula; and optic nerve.If you have a refractive error and are going to need glasses or contacts; then you will also have a refraction test. When you have this test; you look through a device that has lenses of different strengths to help your eye care professional figure out which lenses will give you the clearest vision.At what age you should start getting these exams and how often you need them depends on many factors. They include your age; race; and overall health.  For example; if you are African American; you are at higher risk of glaucoma and you need to start getting the exams earlier. If you have diabetes; you should get an exam every year. Check with your health care provider about if and when you need these exams.
Eye Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/eyediseases.html,Some eye problems are minor and don't last long. But some can lead to a permanent loss of vision.Common eye problems includeRefractive errorsCataracts - clouded lensesOptic nerve disorders; including glaucomaRetinal disorders - problems with the nerve layer at the back of the eyeMacular degeneration - a disease that destroys sharp; central visionDiabetic eye problemsConjunctivitis - an  infection also known as pinkeyeYour best defense is to have regular checkups; because eye diseases do not always have symptoms. Early detection and treatment could prevent vision loss. See an eye care professional right away if you have a sudden change in vision; if everything looks dim; or if you see flashes of light. Other symptoms that need quick attention are pain; double vision; fluid coming from the eye; and inflammation.NIH: National Eye Institute
Eye Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/eyeinfections.html,Your eyes can get infections from bacteria; fungi; or viruses. Eye infections can occur in different parts of the eye and can affect just one eye or both. Two common eye infections areConjunctivitis - also known as pinkeye. Conjunctivitis is often due to an infection. Children frequently get it; and it is very contagious. Stye - a bump on the eyelid that happens when bacteria from your skin get into the hair follicle of an eyelash.Symptoms of eye infections may include redness; itching; swelling; discharge; pain; or problems with vision. Treatment depends on the cause of the infection and may include compresses; eye drops; creams; or antibiotics.
Eye Injuries,https://medlineplus.gov/eyeinjuries.html,The structure of your face helps protect your eyes from injury. Still; injuries can damage your eye; sometimes severely enough that you could lose your vision. Most eye injuries are preventable. If you play sports or work in certain jobs; you may need protection. The most common type of injury happens when something irritates the outer surface of your eye. Certain jobs such as industrial jobs or hobbies such as carpentry make this type of injury more likely. It's also more likely if you wear contact lenses. Chemicals or heat can burn your eyes. With chemicals; the pain may cause you to close your eyes.  This traps the irritant next to the eye and may cause more damage. You should wash out your eye right away while you wait for medical help.
Eye Movement Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eyemovementdisorders.html,When you look at an object; you're using several muscles to move both eyes to focus on it. If you have a problem with the muscles; the eyes don't work properly.There are many kinds of eye movement disorders. Two common ones areStrabismus - a disorder in which the two eyes don't line up in the same direction. This results in "crossed eyes" or "walleye."Nystagmus - fast; uncontrollable movements of the eyes; sometimes called "dancing eyes"Some eye movement disorders are present at birth. Others develop over time and may be associated with other problems; such as injuries. Treatments include glasses; patches; eye muscle exercises; and surgery. There is no cure for some kinds of eye movement disorders; such as most kinds of nystagmus.
Eye Wear,https://medlineplus.gov/eyewear.html,Eye wear protects or corrects your vision. Examples areSunglassesSafety gogglesGlasses (also called eyeglasses)Contact lensesIf you need corrective lenses; you may be able to choose between contacts or glasses.   Either usually requires a prescription. Almost anyone can wear glasses.  Contact lenses require more careful handling. Many jobs and some sports carry a risk of eye injury. Thousands of children and adults get eye injuries every year. Most are preventable with proper eye protection. Everyone is at risk for eye damage from the sun year-round. It's important to regularly use sunglasses that block out at least 99 percent of UV rays.

Eyelid Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eyeliddisorders.html,Your eyelids help protect your eyes. When you blink; your eyelids spread moisture over your eyes. Blinking also helps move dirt or other particles off the surface of the eye.  You close your eyelids when you see something coming toward your eyes.  This can help protect against injuries.Like most other parts of your body; your eyelids can get infected; inflamed; or even develop cancer. There are also specific eyelid problems; includingEyelids that turn in or outEyelids that droopAbnormal blinking or twitchingTreatment of eyelid problems depends on the cause.
Facial Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/facialinjuriesanddisorders.html,Face injuries and disorders can cause pain and affect how you look. In severe cases; they can affect sight; speech; breathing and your ability to swallow. Broken bones; especially the bones of your nose; cheekbone and jaw; are common facial injuries.Certain diseases also lead to facial disorders. For example; nerve diseases like trigeminal neuralgia or Bell's palsy sometimes cause facial pain; spasms and trouble with eye or facial movement. Birth defects can also affect the face. They can cause underdeveloped or unusually prominent facial features or a lack of facial expression. Cleft lip and palate are a common facial birth defect.
Growth Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/growthdisorders.html,Does your child seem much shorter - or much taller - than other kids his or her age? It could be normal. Some children may be small for their age but still be developing normally. Some children are short or tall because their parents are.But some children have growth disorders.  Growth disorders are problems that prevent children from developing normal height; weight; sexual maturity or other features.Very slow or very fast growth can sometimes signal a gland problem or disease.The pituitary gland makes growth hormone; which stimulates the growth of bone and other tissues. Children who have too little of it may be very short. Treatment with growth hormone can stimulate growth.People can also have too much growth hormone.  Usually the cause is a pituitary gland tumor; which is not cancer.  Too much growth hormone can cause gigantism in children; where their bones and their body grow too much.  In adults; it can cause acromegaly; which makes the hands; feet and face larger than normal. Possible treatments include surgery to remove the tumor; medicines; and radiation therapy.
Fainting,https://medlineplus.gov/fainting.html,Fainting is a temporary loss of consciousness. If you're about to faint; you'll feel dizzy; lightheaded; or nauseous. Your field of vision may "white out" or "black out."  Your skin may be cold and clammy.  You lose muscle control at the same time; and may fall down.Fainting usually happens when your blood pressure drops suddenly; causing a decrease in blood flow to your brain. It is more common in older people. Some causes of fainting includeHeat or dehydration Emotional distress Standing up too quickly Certain medicines Drop in blood sugar Heart problems When someone faints; make sure that the airway is clear and check for breathing. The person should stay lying down for 10-15 minutes.  Most people recover completely. Fainting is usually nothing to worry about; but it can sometimes be a sign of a serious problem. If you faint; it's important to see your health care provider and find out why it happened.
Falls,https://medlineplus.gov/falls.html,A fall can change your life. If you're elderly; it can lead to disability and a loss of independence. If your bones are fragile from osteoporosis; you could break a bone; often a hip. But aging alone doesn't make people fall. Diabetes and heart disease affect balance. So do problems with circulation; thyroid or nervous systems. Some medicines make people dizzy. Eye problems or alcohol can be factors. Any of these things can make a fall more likely. Babies and young children are also at risk of falling - off of furniture and down stairs; for example. Falls and accidents seldom "just happen." Taking care of your health by exercising and getting regular eye exams and physicals may help reduce your chance of falling. Getting rid of tripping hazards in your home and wearing nonskid shoes may also help. To reduce the chances of breaking a bone if you do fall; make sure that you get enough calcium and vitamin D.  NIH: National Institute on Aging
Dentures,https://medlineplus.gov/dentures.html,Dentures are false teeth made to replace teeth you have lost. Dentures can be complete or partial. Complete dentures cover your entire upper or lower jaw. Partials replace one or a few teeth. Advances in dentistry have made many improvements in dentures. They are more natural looking and comfortable than they used to be. But they still may feel strange at first. In the beginning; your dentist may want to see you often to make sure the dentures fit. Over time; your mouth will change and your dentures may need to be adjusted or replaced. Be sure to let your dentist handle these adjustments. Speaking and eating may feel different with dentures. Be careful when wearing dentures because they may make it harder for you to feel hot foods and liquids. Also; you may not notice biting on a bone from your food. NIH: National Institute on Aging
Cholesterol,https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterol.html,Cholesterol is a waxy; fat-like substance that occurs naturally in all parts of the body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much in your blood; it can combine with other substances in the blood and stick to the walls of your arteries. This is called plaque. Plaque can narrow your arteries or even block them.High levels of cholesterol in the blood can increase your risk of heart disease. Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older. There are usually no signs or symptoms that you have high blood cholesterol; but it can be detected with a blood test. You are likely to have high cholesterol if members of your family have it; if you are overweight or if you eat a lot of fatty foods.You can lower your cholesterol by exercising more and eating more fruits and vegetables. You also may need to take medicine to lower your cholesterol.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Triglycerides,https://medlineplus.gov/triglycerides.html,Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. Too much of this type of fat may raise the risk of coronary artery disease; especially in women.A blood test measures your triglycerides along with your cholesterol.  Normal triglyceride levels are below 150. Levels above 200 are high.Factors that can raise your triglyceride level includeBeing overweightLack of physical activitySmokingExcessive alcohol useA very high carbohydrate dietCertain diseases and medicinesSome genetic disordersYou may be able to lower your triglycerides with a combination of losing weight; diet; and exercise.

Family History,https://medlineplus.gov/familyhistory.html,Your family history includes health information about you and your close relatives. Families have many factors in common; including their genes; environment; and lifestyle. Looking at these factors can help you figure out whether you have a higher risk for certain health problems; such as heart disease; stroke; and cancer.Having a family member with a disease raises your risk; but it does not mean that you will definitely get it. Knowing that you are at risk gives you a chance to reduce that risk by following a healthier lifestyle and getting tested as needed. You can get started by talking to your relatives about their health. Draw a family tree and add the health information. Having copies of medical records and death certificates is also helpful. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Family Issues,https://medlineplus.gov/familyissues.html,There are many kinds of families. Some have two parents; while others have a single parent. Sometimes there is no parent and grandparents raise grandchildren. Some children live in foster families; adoptive families; or in stepfamilies.Families are much more than groups of people who share the same genes or the same address. They should be a source of love and support. This does not mean that everyone gets along all the time. Conflicts are a part of family life. Many things can lead to conflict; such as illness; disability; addiction; job loss; school problems; and marital  issues.  Listening to each other and working to resolve conflicts are important in strengthening the family.
Birth Control,https://medlineplus.gov/birthcontrol.html,Birth control; also known as contraception; is designed to prevent pregnancy. Birth control methods may work in a number of different ways:Preventing sperm from getting to the eggs. Types include condoms; diaphragms; cervical caps; and contraceptive sponges.Keeping the woman's ovaries from releasing eggs that could be fertilized. Types include birth control pills; patches; shots; vaginal rings; and emergency contraceptive pills.IUDs; devices which are implanted into the uterus. They can be kept in place for several years.Sterilization; which permanently prevents a woman from getting pregnant or a man from being able to get a woman pregnant Your choice of birth control should depend on several factors. These include your health; frequency of sexual activity; number of sexual partners and desire to have children in the future. Your health care provider can help you select the best form of birth control for you.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Aplastic Anemia,https://medlineplus.gov/aplasticanemia.html,Aplastic anemia is a rare but serious blood disorder.  If you have it; your bone marrow doesn't make enough new blood cells. There are different types; including Fanconi anemia. Causes includeToxic substances; such as pesticides; arsenic; and benzeneRadiation therapy and chemotherapy for cancerCertain medicinesInfections such as hepatitis; Epstein-Barr virus; or HIVAutoimmune disordersCertain inherited conditionsPregnancyIn many people; the cause is unknown.Symptoms include fatigue; weakness; dizziness; and shortness of breath. It can cause heart problems such as an irregular heartbeat; an enlarged heart; and heart failure. You may also have frequent infections and bleeding.Your doctor will diagnose aplastic anemia based on your medical and family histories; a physical exam; and test results. Once your doctor knows the cause and severity of the condition; he or she can create a treatment plan for you. Treatments include blood transfusions; blood and marrow stem cell transplants; and medicines.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Farm Health and Safety,https://medlineplus.gov/farmhealthandsafety.html,You might think of farms as peaceful settings. Actually; farming is one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States. Farms have many health and safety hazards; includingChemicals and pesticidesMachinery; tools and equipment that can be dangerousHazardous areas; such as grain bins; silos and wellsLivestock that can spread diseases or cause injuriesFarming injuries are very common. Physical labor and accidents can cause injuries. Most farm accidents involve machinery. Proper machine inspection and maintenance can help prevent accidents. Using safety gloves; goggles and other protective equipment can also reduce accidents. Occupational Safety and Health Administration
Interstitial Lung Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/interstitiallungdiseases.html,Interstitial lung disease is the name for a large group of diseases that inflame or scar the lungs. The inflammation and scarring make it hard to get enough oxygen. The scarring is called pulmonary fibrosis.Breathing in dust or other particles in the air is responsible for some types of interstitial lung diseases. Specific types includeBlack lung disease among coal miners; from inhaling coal dustFarmer's lung; from inhaling farm dustAsbestosis; from inhaling asbestos fibersSiderosis; from inhaling iron from mines or welding fumesSilicosis; from inhaling silica dustOther causes include autoimmune diseases or occupational exposures to molds; gases; or fumes. Some types of interstitial lung disease have no known cause.Treatment depends on the type of exposure and the stage of the disease. It may involve medicines; oxygen therapy; or a lung transplant in severe cases.

Refractive Errors,https://medlineplus.gov/refractiveerrors.html,The cornea and lens of your eye helps you focus.  Refractive errors are vision problems that happen when the shape of the eye keeps you from focusing well. The cause could be the length of the eyeball (longer or shorter); changes in the shape of the cornea; or aging of the lens.Four common refractive errors areMyopia; or nearsightedness - clear vision close up but  blurry in the distanceHyperopia; or farsightedness - clear vision in the distance but blurry close upPresbyopia - inability to focus close up as a result of agingAstigmatism - focus problems caused by the corneaThe most common symptom is blurred vision. Other symptoms may include double vision; haziness; glare or halos around bright lights; squinting; headaches; or eye strain.Glasses or contact lenses can usually correct refractive errors. Laser eye surgery may also be a possibility.NIH: National Eye Institute
Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/fetalalcoholspectrumdisorders.html,Alcohol can harm your baby at any stage during a pregnancy. That includes the earliest stages before you even know you are pregnant. Drinking alcohol can cause a group of conditions called fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Effects can include physical and behavioral problems such as trouble withLearning and rememberingUnderstanding and following directionsControlling emotionsCommunicating and socializingDaily life skills; such as feeding and bathingFetal alcohol syndrome is the most serious type of FASD. People with fetal alcohol syndrome have facial abnormalities; including wide-set and narrow eyes; growth problems and nervous system abnormalities.FASDs last a lifetime. There is no cure for FASDs. Treatments can help. These include medicines to help with some symptoms and behavior therapy. No one treatment is right for every child.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Fatigue,https://medlineplus.gov/fatigue.html,Everyone feels tired now and then. Sometimes you may just want to stay in bed. But; after a good night's sleep; most people feel refreshed and ready to face a new day. If you continue to feel tired for weeks; it's time to see your doctor. He or she may be able to help you find out what's causing your fatigue and recommend ways to relieve it.Fatigue itself is not a disease. Medical problems; treatments; and personal habits can add to fatigue. These includeTaking certain medicines; such as antidepressants; antihistamines; and medicines for nausea and painHaving medical treatments; like chemotherapy and radiationRecovering from major surgeryAnxiety; stress; or depressionStaying up too lateDrinking too much alcohol or too many caffeinated drinksPregnancyOne disorder that causes extreme fatigue is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This fatigue is not the kind of tired feeling that goes away after you rest. Instead; it lasts a long time and limits your ability to do ordinary daily activities.NIH: National Institute on Aging
Dietary Fats,https://medlineplus.gov/dietaryfats.html,Fat is a type of nutrient. You need some fat in your diet but not too much. Fats give you energy and help your body absorb vitamins. Dietary fat also plays a major role in your cholesterol levels.But not all fats are the same. You should try to avoidSaturated fats such as butter; solid shortening; and lardTrans fats. These are found in vegetable shortenings; some margarines; crackers; cookies; snack foods; and other foods made with or fried in partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs). By 2018; most U.S. companies will not be allowed to add PHOs to food.Try to replace them with oils such as canola; olive; safflower; sesame; or sunflower. Of course; eating too much fat will put on the pounds.  Fat has twice as many calories as proteins or carbohydrates.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Fatty Liver Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/fattyliverdisease.html,What is fatty liver disease?Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons. Fatty liver disease is a condition in which fat builds up in your liver. There are two main types:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)Alcoholic fatty liver disease; also called alcoholic steatohepatitisWhat is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)?NAFLD is a type of fatty liver disease that is not related to heavy alcohol use. There are two kinds:Simple fatty liver; in which you have fat in your liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Simple fatty liver typically does not get bad enough to cause liver damage or complications.Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage; as well as fat in your liver. Inflammation and liver cell damage can cause fibrosis; or scarring; of the liver. NASH may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.What is alcoholic fatty liver disease?Alcoholic fatty liver disease is due to heavy alcohol use. Your liver breaks down most of the alcohol you drink; so it can be removed from your body. But the process of breaking it down can generate harmful substances. These substances can damage liver cells; promote inflammation; and weaken your body's natural defenses. The more alcohol that you drink; the more you damage your liver.  Alcoholic fatty liver disease is the earliest stage of alcohol-related liver disease. The next stages are alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.Who gets fatty liver disease?Researchers do not know the cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). They do know that it is more common in people whoHave type 2 diabetes and prediabetesHave obesityAre middle aged or older (although children can also get it)Are Hispanic; followed by non-Hispanic whites. It is less common in African Americans.Have high levels of fats in the blood; such as cholesterol and triglyceridesHave high blood pressureTake certain drugs; such as corticosteroids and some cancer drugsHave certain metabolic disorders; including metabolic syndromeHave rapid weight lossHave certain infections; such as hepatitis CHave been exposed to some toxinsNAFLD affects about 25 percent of people in the world. As the rates of obesity; type 2 diabetes; and high cholesterol are rising in the United States; so is the rate of NAFLD. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disorder in the United States.Alcoholic fatty liver disease only happens in people who are heavy drinkers; especially those who have been drinking for a long period of time. The risk is higher for heavy drinkers who are women; have obesity; or have certain genetic mutations.What are the symptoms of fatty liver disease?Both NAFLD and alcoholic fatty liver disease are usually silent diseases with few or no symptoms. If you do have symptoms; you may feel tired or have discomfort in the upper right side of your abdomen.How do I know if I have fatty liver disease?Because there are often no symptoms; it is not easy to find fatty liver disease. Your doctor may suspect that you have it if you get abnormal results on liver tests that you had for other reasons. To make a diagnosis; your doctor will useYour medical historyA physical examVarious tests; including blood and imaging tests; and sometimes a biopsyAs part of the medical history; your doctor will ask about your alcohol use; to find out whether fat in your liver is a sign of alcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). He or she will also ask which medicines you take; to try to determine whether a medicine is causing your NAFLD.During the physical exam; your doctor will examine your body and check your weight and height. Your doctor will look for signs of fatty liver disease; such asAn enlarged liverSigns of cirrhosis; such as jaundice; a condition that causes your skin and whites of your eyes to turn yellowYou will likely have blood tests; including liver function tests and blood count tests. In some cases you may also have imaging tests; like those that check for fat in the liver and the stiffness of your liver. Liver stiffness can mean fibrosis; which is scarring of the liver. In some cases you may also need a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis; and to check how bad the liver damage is.What are the treatments for fatty liver disease?Doctors recommend weight loss for nonalcoholic fatty liver. Weight loss can reduce fat in the liver; inflammation; and fibrosis. If your doctor thinks that a certain medicine is the cause of your NAFLD; you should stop taking that medicine.  But check with your doctor before stopping the medicine. You may need to get off the medicine gradually; and you might need to switch to another medicine instead.There are no medicines that have been approved to treat NAFLD. Studies are investigating whether a certain diabetes medicine or Vitamin E can help; but more studies are needed.The most important part of treating alcohol-related fatty liver disease is to stop drinking alcohol. If you need help doing that; you may want to see a therapist or participate in an alcohol recovery program. There are also medicines that can help; either by reducing your cravings or making you feel sick if you drink alcohol.Both alcoholic fatty liver disease and one type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) can lead to cirrhosis. Doctors can treat the health problems caused by cirrhosis with medicines; operations; and other medical procedures. If the cirrhosis leads to liver failure; you may need a liver transplant.What are some lifestyle changes that can help with fatty liver disease?If you have any of the types of fatty liver disease; there are some lifestyle changes that can help:Eat a healthy diet; limiting salt and sugar; plus eating lots of fruits; vegetables; and whole grainsGet vaccinations for hepatitis A and B; the flu and pneumococcal disease. If you get hepatitis A or B along with fatty liver; it is more likely to lead to liver failure. People with chronic liver disease are more likely to get infections; so the other two vaccinations are also important.Get regular exercise; which can help you lose weight and reduce fat in the liverTalk with your doctor before using dietary supplements; such as vitamins; or any complementary or alternative medicines or medical practices. Some herbal remedies can damage your liver.
Intestinal Obstruction,https://medlineplus.gov/intestinalobstruction.html,An intestinal obstruction occurs when food or stool cannot move through the intestines. The obstruction can be complete or partial. There are many causes. The most common are adhesions; hernias; cancers; and certain medicines.  Symptoms include  Severe abdominal pain or cramping  Vomiting  Bloating  Loud bowel sounds  Swelling of the abdomen  Inability to pass gas  Constipation  A complete intestinal obstruction is a medical emergency.  It often requires surgery. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

If a woman keeps having miscarriages; it is also called infertility.  Female infertility can result from age; physical problems; hormone problems; and lifestyle or environmental factors.Most cases of infertility in women result from problems with producing eggs. In premature ovarian failure; the ovaries stop functioning before natural menopause.  In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); the ovaries may not release an egg regularly or they may not release a healthy egg.About a third of the time; infertility is because of a problem with the woman. One third of the time; it is a problem with the man. Sometimes no cause can be found.If you think you might be infertile; see your doctor. There are tests that may tell if you have fertility problems. When it is possible to find the cause; treatments may include medicines; surgery; or assisted reproductive technologies. Happily; many couples treated for infertility are able to have babies.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health

Tubal Ligation,https://medlineplus.gov/tuballigation.html,Tubal ligation (getting your "tubes tied") is a type of surgery. It prevents a woman from getting pregnant. It is a permanent form of birth control; and is effective right away.The surgery cuts; ties; or seals the fallopian tubes. This blocks the path between the ovaries and the uterus. The sperm cannot reach the egg to fertilize it; and the egg cannot reach the uterus. You get the surgery in a hospital or outpatient surgical center. It usually takes about 30 minutes. Almost all women go home the same day. They can return to most normal activities within a few days.Tubal ligation can sometimes be reversed. The reversal is major surgery; and does not always work.
Iron,https://medlineplus.gov/iron.html,Iron is a mineral that our bodies need for many functions. For example; iron is part of hemoglobin; a protein which carries oxygen from our lungs throughout our bodies. It helps our muscles store and use oxygen. Iron is also part of many other proteins and enzymes.Your body needs the right amount of iron. If you have too little iron; you may develop iron deficiency anemia. Causes of low iron levels include blood loss; poor diet; or an inability to absorb enough iron from foods. People at higher risk of having too little iron are young children and women who are pregnant or have periods.Too much iron can damage your body.  Taking too many iron supplements can cause iron poisoning. Some people have an inherited disease called hemochromatosis.  It causes too much iron to build up in the body.

If a woman can get pregnant but keeps having miscarriages or stillbirths; that's also called infertility.Infertility is fairly common. After one year of having unprotected sex; about 15 percent of couples are unable to get pregnant. About a third of the time; infertility can be traced to the woman. In another third of cases; it is because of the man. The rest of the time; it is because of both partners or no cause can be found.There are treatments that are specifically for men or for women. Some involve both partners. Drugs; assisted reproductive technology; and surgery are common treatments.

Fever,https://medlineplus.gov/fever.html,A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal. A normal temperature can vary from person to person; but it is usually around 98.6 F. A fever is not a disease. It is usually a sign that your body is trying to fight an illness or infection.Infections cause most fevers. You get a fever because your body is trying to kill the virus or bacteria that caused the infection. Most of those bacteria and viruses do well when your body is at your normal temperature. But if you have a fever; it is harder for them to survive. Fever also activates your body's immune system.Other causes of fevers includeMedicines; including some antibiotics; blood pressure medicines; and anti-seizure medicinesHeat illnessCancersAutoimmune diseasesSome childhood immunizationsTreatment depends on the cause of your fever. If the fever is very high; your health care provider may recommend taking an over-the-counter medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

Type 2 usually affects the genital area.Some people have no symptoms from the infection. But others develop painful and unsightly cold sores. Cold sores usually occur outside the mouth; on or around the lips. When they are inside the mouth; they are usually on the gums or the roof of the mouth. They are not the same as canker sores; which are not contagious.There is no cure for cold sores. They normally go away on their own in a few weeks.  Antiviral medicines can help them heal faster.  They can also help to prevent cold sores in people who often get them. Other medicines can help with the pain and discomfort of the sores. These include ointments that numb the blisters; soften the crusts of the sores; or dry them out. Protecting your lips from the sun with sunblock lip balm can also help.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is for people whose hearts or breathing has stopped and the Heimlich maneuver is for people who are choking.You can also learn to handle common injuries and wounds. Cuts and scrapes; for example; should be rinsed with cool water. To stop bleeding; apply firm but gentle pressure; using gauze. If blood soaks through; add more gauze; keeping the first layer in place. Continue to apply pressure. It is important to have a first aid kit available.  Keep one at home and one in your car. It should include a first-aid guide.  Read the guide to learn how to use the items; so you are ready in case an emergency happens.
Fistulas,https://medlineplus.gov/fistulas.html,A fistula is an abnormal connection between two parts inside of the body. Fistulas may develop between different organs; such as between the esophagus and the windpipe or the bowel and the vagina. They can also develop between two blood vessels; such as between an artery and a vein or between two arteries.Some people are born with a fistula. Other common causes of fistulas includeComplications from surgeryInjuryInfectionDiseases; such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitisTreatment depends on the cause of the fistula; where it is; and how bad it is.

What you eat and drink is also important. Water is the most important nutrient for active people. Drink it before; during and after workouts.
Gas,https://medlineplus.gov/gas.html,Everyone has gas. Most people pass gas 13 to 21 times a day. Passing gas through the mouth is called belching or burping.  Passing gas through the anus is called flatulence. Most of the time gas does not have an odor. The odor comes from bacteria in the large intestine that release small amounts of gases that contain sulfur.Gas in the digestive tract comes from two sources: air that you swallow and the breakdown of undigested food by bacteria in the large intestine.  Certain foods may cause gas.  Foods that produce gas in one person may not cause gas in another.You can reduce the amount of gas you have byDrinking lots of water and non-fizzy drinksEating more slowly so you swallow less air when you eatAvoiding milk products if you have lactose intoleranceMedicines can help reduce gas or the pain and bloating caused by gas. If your symptoms still bother you; see your health care provider.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Insect Bites and Stings,https://medlineplus.gov/insectbitesandstings.html,Most insect bites are harmless; though they sometimes cause discomfort. Bee; wasp; and hornet stings and fire ant bites usually hurt. Mosquito and flea bites usually itch. Insects can also spread diseases. In the United States; some mosquitoes spread West Nile virus. Travelers outside the United States may be at risk for malaria and other infections. To prevent insect bites and their complicationsDon't bother insectsUse insect repellant Wear protective clothing Be careful when you eat outside because food attracts insectsIf you know you have severe allergic reactions to insect bites and stings (such as anaphylaxis); carry an emergency epinephrine kit
Bacterial Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/bacterialinfections.html,Bacteria are living things that have only one cell.  Under a microscope; they look like balls; rods; or spirals. They are so small that a line of 1;000 could fit across a pencil eraser. Most bacteria won't hurt you - less than 1 percent of the different types make people sick. Many are helpful. Some bacteria help to digest food; destroy disease-causing cells; and give the body needed vitamins. Bacteria are also used in making healthy foods like yogurt and cheese.But infectious bacteria can make you ill. They reproduce quickly in your body. Many give off chemicals called toxins; which can damage tissue and make you sick. Examples of bacteria that cause infections include Streptococcus; Staphylococcus; and E. coli.Antibiotics are the usual treatment. When you take antibiotics; follow the directions carefully. Each time you take antibiotics; you increase the chances that bacteria in your body will learn to resist them causing antibiotic resistance. Later; you could get or spread an infection that those antibiotics cannot cure.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Retinal Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/retinaldisorders.html,The retina is a layer of tissue in the back of your eye that senses light and sends images to your brain. In the center of this nerve tissue is the macula. It provides the sharp; central vision needed for reading; driving and seeing fine detail.Retinal disorders affect this vital tissue.

Floods,https://medlineplus.gov/floods.html,Floods are common in the United States.  Weather such as heavy rain; thunderstorms; hurricanes; or tsunamis can cause flooding.  Flooding can also happen when a river or stream overflows its bank; when a levee is breached; or when a dam breaks. Flash floods; which can develop quickly; often have a dangerous wall of roaring water.  The wall carries rocks; mud; and rubble and can sweep away most things in its path.Be aware of flood hazards no matter where you live; but especially if you live in a low-lying area; near water or downstream from a dam.  Although there are no guarantees of safety during a flood; you can take actions to protect yourself.  You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear; anxiety; and losses. If you do experience a disaster; it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.Federal Emergency Management Agency

Stomach Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/stomachdisorders.html,Your stomach is an organ between your esophagus and small intestine. It is where digestion of protein begins. The stomach has three tasks. It stores swallowed food. It mixes the food with stomach acids. Then it sends the mixture on to the small intestine.Most people have a problem with their stomach at one time or another. Indigestion and heartburn are common problems. You can relieve some stomach problems with over-the-counter medicines and lifestyle changes; such as avoiding fatty foods or eating more slowly. Other problems like peptic ulcers or GERD require medical attention. You should see a doctor if you have any of the following:Blood when you have a bowel movementSevere abdominal painHeartburn not relieved by antacids Unintended weight loss Ongoing vomiting or diarrheaNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Gastroenteritis,https://medlineplus.gov/gastroenteritis.html, Have you ever had the "stomach flu?" What you probably had was gastroenteritis - not a type of flu at all.  Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the lining of the intestines caused by a virus; bacteria or parasites.  Viral gastroenteritis is the second most common illness in the U.S. The cause is often a norovirus infection. It spreads through contaminated food or water; and contact with an infected person.  The best prevention is frequent hand washing.  Symptoms of gastroenteritis include diarrhea; abdominal pain; vomiting; headache; fever and chills.  Most people recover with no treatment.The most common problem with gastroenteritis is dehydration. This happens if you do not drink enough fluids to replace what you lose through vomiting and diarrhea. Dehydration is most common in babies; young children; the elderly and people with weak immune systems.  NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
GERD,https://medlineplus.gov/gerd.html,Your esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) happens when a muscle at the end of your esophagus does not close properly. This allows stomach contents to leak back; or reflux; into the esophagus and irritate it. You may feel a burning in the chest or throat called heartburn.  Sometimes; you can taste stomach fluid in the back of the mouth.  If you have these symptoms more than twice a week; you may have GERD. You can also have GERD without having heartburn. Your symptoms could include a dry cough; asthma symptoms; or trouble swallowing.Anyone; including infants and children; can have GERD.  If not treated; it can lead to more serious health problems. In some cases; you might need medicines or surgery.  However; many people can improve their symptoms byAvoiding alcohol and spicy; fatty or acidic foods that trigger heartburnEating smaller mealsNot eating close to bedtime Losing weight if needed Wearing loose-fitting clothesNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Gastrointestinal Bleeding,https://medlineplus.gov/gastrointestinalbleeding.html,Your digestive or gastrointestinal (GI) tract includes the esophagus; stomach; small intestine; large intestine or colon; rectum; and anus. Bleeding can come from any of these areas. The amount of bleeding can be so small that only a lab test can find it. Signs of bleeding in the digestive tract depend where it is and how much bleeding there is.Signs of bleeding in the upper digestive tract includeBright red blood in vomitVomit that looks like coffee groundsBlack or tarry stoolDark blood mixed with stoolSigns of bleeding in the lower digestive tract includeBlack or tarry stoolDark blood mixed with stoolStool mixed or coated with bright red bloodGI bleeding is not a disease; but a symptom of a disease. There are many possible causes of GI bleeding; including hemorrhoids; peptic ulcers; tears or inflammation in the esophagus; diverticulosis and diverticulitis; ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; colonic polyps; or cancer in the colon; stomach or  esophagus.The test used most often to look for the cause of GI bleeding is called endoscopy. It uses a flexible instrument inserted through the mouth or rectum to view the inside of the GI tract. A type of endoscopy called colonoscopy looks at the large intestine.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Digestive Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/digestivediseases.html,When you eat; your body breaks food down to a form it can use to build and nourish cells and provide energy. This process is called digestion.  Your digestive system is a series of hollow organs joined in a long; twisting tube. It runs from your mouth to your anus and includes your esophagus; stomach; and small and large intestines.  Your liver; gallbladder and pancreas are also involved.  They produce juices to help digestion.  There are many types of digestive disorders. The symptoms vary widely depending on the problem. In general; you should see your doctor if you have  Blood in your stool Changes in bowel habits Severe abdominal pain Unintentional weight loss Heartburn not relieved by antacids  NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Intestinal Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/intestinalcancer.html,Your small intestine is part of your digestive system.  It is a long tube that connects your stomach to your large intestine. Intestinal cancer is rare; but eating a high-fat diet or having Crohn's disease; celiac disease; or a history of  colonic polyps can increase your risk.Possible signs of small intestine cancer includeAbdominal painWeight loss for no reasonBlood in the stoolA lump in the abdomenImaging tests that create pictures of the small intestine and the area around it can help diagnose intestinal cancer and show whether it has spread.Surgery is the most common treatment. Additional options include chemotherapy; radiation therapy; or a combination.NIH: National Cancer Institute

Weight Loss Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/weightlosssurgery.html,Weight loss surgery helps people with extreme obesity to lose weight. It may be an option if you cannot lose weight through diet and exercise or have serious health problems caused by obesity.There are different types of weight loss surgery.  They often limit the amount of food you can take in. Some types of surgery also affect how you digest food and absorb nutrients. All types have risks and complications; such as infections; hernias; and blood clots.Many people who have the surgery lose weight quickly; but regain some weight later on.  If you follow diet and exercise recommendations; you can keep most of the weight off. You will also need medical follow-up for the rest of your life.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Gaucher Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/gaucherdisease.html,Gaucher disease is a rare; inherited disorder. It is a type of lipid metabolism disorder. If you have it; you do not have enough of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase.  This causes too much of a fatty substance to build up in your spleen; liver; lungs; bones and; sometimes; your brain. This prevents these organs from working properly.There are three types:Type 1; the most common form; causes liver and spleen enlargement; bone pain and broken bones; and; sometimes; lung and kidney problems. It does not affect the brain. It can occur at any age.Type 2; which causes severe brain damage; appears in infants. Most children who have it die by age 2.In type 3; there may be liver and spleen enlargement. The brain is gradually affected. It usually starts in childhood or adolescence.Gaucher disease has no cure. Treatment options for types 1 and 3 include medicine and enzyme replacement therapy; which is usually very effective. There is no good treatment for the brain damage of types 2 and 3.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Health,https://medlineplus.gov/gaylesbianbisexualandtransgenderhealth.html,Gay; lesbian; bisexual; and transgender individuals have special health concerns besides the usual ones that affect most men and women. On this page you'll find information about these specific health issues.
Anxiety,https://medlineplus.gov/anxiety.html,Fear and anxiety are part of life. You may feel anxious before you take a test or walk down a dark street. This kind of anxiety is useful - it can make you more alert or careful. It usually ends soon after you are out of the situation that caused it. But for millions of people in the United States; the anxiety does not go away; and gets worse over time. They may have chest pains or nightmares. They may even be afraid to leave home.  These people have anxiety disorders.  Types include  Panic disorder  Obsessive-compulsive disorder  Post-traumatic stress disorder  Phobias  Generalized anxiety disorder   Treatment can involve medicines; therapy or both.

Genes and Gene Therapy,https://medlineplus.gov/genesandgenetherapy.html,Genes are the building blocks of inheritance. Passed from parent to child; they contain instructions for making proteins. If genes don't produce the right proteins or don't produce them correctly; a child can have a genetic disorder.  Gene therapy is an experimental technique that uses genes to treat or prevent disease. The most common form of gene therapy involves inserting a normal gene to replace an abnormal gene. Other approaches include  Swapping an abnormal gene for a normal one Repairing an abnormal gene Altering the degree to which a gene is turned on or off  Although there is much hope for gene therapy; it is still experimental.  Genetics Home Reference
Genetic Brain Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/geneticbraindisorders.html,A genetic brain disorder is caused by a variation or a mutation in a gene.  A variation is a different form of a gene. A mutation is a change in a gene. Genetic brain disorders affect the development and function of the brain.Some genetic brain disorders are due to random gene mutations or mutations caused by environmental exposure; such as cigarette smoke. Other disorders are inherited; which means that a mutated gene or group of genes is passed down through a family. They can also be due to a combination of both genetic changes and other outside factors.Some examples of genetic brain disorders includeLeukodystrophiesPhenylketonuriaTay-Sachs diseaseWilson diseaseMany people with genetic brain disorders fail to produce enough of certain proteins that influence brain development and function. These brain disorders can cause serious problems that affect the nervous system. Some have treatments to control symptoms.  Some are life-threatening.
Genetic Counseling,https://medlineplus.gov/geneticcounseling.html,Genetic counseling provides information and support to people who have; or may be at risk for; genetic disorders. A genetic counselor meets with you to discuss genetic risks. The counseling may be for yourself or a family member. Or you may get it when you are planning or expecting a baby. You may follow up with  genetic testing. There are many reasons to seek genetic counseling. You may consider it if you Have a personal or family history of a genetic condition or birth defectAre pregnant or planning to be pregnant after age 35Already have a child with a genetic disorder or birth defectHave had two or more pregnancy losses or a baby who diedHave had ultrasound or screening tests that suggest a possible problemGenetics Home Reference
Genetic Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/geneticdisorders.html,Genes are the building blocks of heredity. They are passed from parent to child. They hold DNA; the instructions for making proteins. Proteins do most of the work in cells. They move molecules from one place to another; build structures; break down toxins; and do many other maintenance jobs.Sometimes there is a mutation; a change in a gene or genes.  The mutation changes the gene's instructions for making a protein; so the protein does not work properly or is missing entirely. This can cause a medical condition called a genetic disorder.You can inherit a gene mutation from one or both parents.  A mutation can also happen during your lifetime.There are three types of genetic disorders:Single-gene disorders; where a mutation affects one gene.  Sickle cell anemia is an example.Chromosomal disorders; where chromosomes (or parts of chromosomes) are missing or changed. Chromosomes are the structures that hold our genes.  Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder.Complex disorders; where there are mutations in two or more genes. Often your lifestyle and environment also play a role.  Colon cancer is an example.Genetic tests on blood and other tissue can identify genetic disorders.NIH: National Library of Medicine
Genetic Testing,https://medlineplus.gov/genetictesting.html,Genetic tests are tests on blood and other tissue to find genetic disorders. Over 2000 tests are available. Doctors use genetic tests for several reasons. These includeFinding genetic diseases in unborn babiesFinding out if people carry a gene for a disease and might pass it on to their childrenScreening embryos for disease Testing for genetic diseases in adults before they cause symptomsMaking a diagnosis in a person who has disease symptomsFiguring out the type or dose of a medicine that is best for a certain personPeople have many different reasons for being tested or not being tested. For some; it is important to know whether a disease can be prevented or treated if a test is positive. In some cases; there is no treatment. But test results might help a person make life decisions; such as family planning or insurance coverage.  A genetic counselor can provide information about the pros and cons of testing.NIH: National Human Genome Research Institute
Genital Herpes,https://medlineplus.gov/genitalherpes.html,Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by a herpes simplex virus (HSV). It can cause sores on your genital or rectal area; buttocks; and thighs.  You can get it from having vaginal; anal; or oral sex with someone who has it. The virus can spread even when sores are not present. Mothers can also infect their babies during childbirth.Symptoms of herpes are called outbreaks.  You usually get sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. The sores are blisters which break and become painful; and then heal. Sometimes people do not know they have herpes because they have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. The virus can be more serious in newborn babies or in people with weak immune systems.Repeat outbreaks are common; especially during the first year. Over time; you get them less often and the symptoms become milder.  The virus stays in your body for life.There are tests that can diagnose genital herpes. There is no cure.  However; medicines can help lessen symptoms; decrease outbreaks; and lower the risk of passing the virus to others. Correct usage of latex condoms can reduce; but not eliminate; the risk of catching or spreading herpes.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Genital Warts,https://medlineplus.gov/genitalwarts.html,Genital warts are a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The warts are soft; moist; pink; or flesh-colored bumps. You can have one or many of these bumps.  In women; the warts usually occur in or around the vagina; on the cervix or around the anus. In men; genital warts are less common but might occur on the tip of the penis. You can get genital warts during oral; vaginal; or anal sex with an infected partner.  Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces; but does not completely eliminate; the risk of catching or spreading HPV. HPV vaccines may help prevent some of the HPV infections that cause genital warts.Your health care provider usually diagnoses genital warts by seeing them. The warts might disappear on their own. If not; your health care provider can treat or remove them. The virus stays in your body even after treatment; so warts can come back.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Tongue Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/tonguedisorders.html,Your tongue helps you taste; swallow; and chew. You also use it to speak.  Your tongue is made up of many muscles. The upper surface contains your taste buds.  Problems with the tongue include  Pain  Swelling Changes in color or texture  Abnormal movement or difficulty moving the tongue  Taste problems  These problems can have many different causes. Treatment depends on the underlying problem.
GERD,https://medlineplus.gov/gerd.html,Your esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) happens when a muscle at the end of your esophagus does not close properly. This allows stomach contents to leak back; or reflux; into the esophagus and irritate it. You may feel a burning in the chest or throat called heartburn.  Sometimes; you can taste stomach fluid in the back of the mouth.  If you have these symptoms more than twice a week; you may have GERD. You can also have GERD without having heartburn. Your symptoms could include a dry cough; asthma symptoms; or trouble swallowing.Anyone; including infants and children; can have GERD.  If not treated; it can lead to more serious health problems. In some cases; you might need medicines or surgery.  However; many people can improve their symptoms byAvoiding alcohol and spicy; fatty or acidic foods that trigger heartburnEating smaller mealsNot eating close to bedtime Losing weight if needed Wearing loose-fitting clothesNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Biodefense and Bioterrorism,https://medlineplus.gov/biodefenseandbioterrorism.html,A bioterrorism attack is the deliberate release of viruses; bacteria; or other germs to cause illness or death. These germs are often found in nature. But they can sometimes be made more harmful by increasing their ability to cause disease; spread; or resist medical treatment.Biological agents spread through the air; water; or in food. Some can also spread from person to person. They can be very hard to detect. They don't cause illness for several hours or days. Scientists worry that anthrax; botulism; Ebola and other hemorrhagic fever viruses; plague; or smallpox could be used as biological agents.Biodefense uses medical measures to protect people against bioterrorism. This includes medicines and vaccinations. It also includes medical research and preparations to defend against bioterrorist attacks.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Rubella,https://medlineplus.gov/rubella.html,Rubella is an infection caused by a virus. It is usually mild with fever and a rash. About half of the people who get rubella do not have symptoms. If you do get them; symptoms may includeA rash that starts on the face and spreads to the bodyMild feverAching joints; especially in young womenSwollen glandsRubella is most dangerous for a pregnant woman's baby. It can cause miscarriage or birth defects.Rubella spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. People without symptoms can still spread it. There is no treatment; but the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine can prevent it.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Germs and Hygiene,https://medlineplus.gov/germsandhygiene.html,When you cough or sneeze; you send tiny germ-filled droplets into the air.  Colds and flu usually spread that way. You can help stop the spread of germs byCovering your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough. Sneeze or cough into your elbow; not your hands.Cleaning your hands often - always before you eat or prepare food; and after you use the bathroom or change a diaper Avoiding touching your eyes; nose or mouthHand washing is one of the most effective and most overlooked ways to stop disease. Soap and water work well to kill germs. Wash for at least 20 seconds and rub your hands briskly.  Disposable hand wipes or gel sanitizers also work well.
Assisted Reproductive Technology,https://medlineplus.gov/assistedreproductivetechnology.html,Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is used to treat infertility. It includes fertility treatments that handle both a woman's egg and a man's sperm. It works by removing eggs from a woman's body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman's body. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most common and effective type of ART. ART procedures sometimes use donor eggs; donor sperm; or previously frozen embryos. It may also involve a surrogate or gestational carrier. A surrogate is a woman who becomes pregnant with sperm from the male partner of the couple. A gestational carrier becomes pregnant with an egg from the female partner and the sperm from the male partner. The most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. It can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are put into the woman's body.
Diabetes and Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetesandpregnancy.html,Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose; or blood sugar; levels are too high. When you are pregnant; high blood sugar levels are not good for your baby.About seven out of every 100 pregnant women in the United States get gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is diabetes that happens for the first time when a woman is pregnant. Most of the time; it goes away after you have your baby. But it does increase your risk for developing type 2 diabetes later on. Your child is also at risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes.Most women get a test to check for diabetes during their second trimester of pregnancy. Women at higher risk may get a test earlier.If you already have diabetes; the best time to control your blood sugar is before you get pregnant. High blood sugar levels can be harmful to your baby during the first weeks of pregnancy - even before you know you are pregnant. To keep you and your baby healthy; it is important to keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible before and during pregnancy.Either type of diabetes during pregnancy increases the chances of problems for you and your baby. To help lower the chances talk to your health care team aboutA meal plan for your pregnancyA safe exercise planHow often to test your blood sugarTaking your medicine as prescribed. Your medicine plan may need to change during pregnancy.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/highbloodpressureinpregnancy.html,If you are pregnant; high blood pressure can cause problems for you and your unborn baby. You may have had high blood pressure before you got pregnant. Or you may get it once you are pregnant - a condition called gestational hypertension. Either one can cause low birth weight or premature delivery of the baby.Controlling your blood pressure during pregnancy and getting regular prenatal care are important for the health of you and your baby. Treatments for high blood pressure in pregnancy may include close monitoring of the baby; lifestyle changes; and certain medicines.Some pregnant women with high blood pressure develop preeclampsia. It's a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It can be life-threatening for both you and the unborn baby. There is no proven way to prevent it. Most women who have signs of preeclampsia are closely monitored to lessen or avoid complications. The only way to "cure" preeclampsia is to deliver the baby.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Tumors and Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/tumorsandpregnancy.html,Tumors during pregnancy are rare; but they can happen. Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. The most common cancers in pregnancy are breast cancer; cervical cancer; lymphoma; and melanoma.  Cancer itself rarely harms the baby; and some cancer treatments are safe during pregnancy.  You and your health care provider will work together to find the best treatment.  Your options will depend on how far along the pregnancy is; as well as the type; size; and stage of your cancer.Another type of tumor that women can get is called a gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). It happens when a fertilized egg doesn't become a fetus.  GTD is not always easy to find.  It is usually benign; but some types can be malignant. The most common type of GTD is a molar pregnancy. In its early stages; it may look like a normal pregnancy. You should see your health care provider if you have vaginal bleeding (not menstrual bleeding). Treatment depends on the type of tumor; whether it has spread to other places; and your overall health.
Club Drugs,https://medlineplus.gov/clubdrugs.html,Club drugs are group of psychoactive drugs.  They act on the central nervous system and can cause changes in mood; awareness; and how you act. These drugs are often abused by young adults at all-night dance parties; dance clubs; and bars. They includeMethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA); also known as Ecstasy XTC; X; E; Adam; Molly; Hug Beans; and Love DrugGamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB); also known as G; Liquid Ecstasy; and SoapKetamine; also known as Special K; K; Vitamin K; and JetRohypnol; also known as RoofiesMethamphetamine; also known as Speed; Ice; Chalk; Meth; Crystal; Crank; and GlassLysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD); also known as Acid; Blotter; and DotsSome of these drugs are approved for certain medical uses. Other uses of these drugs are abuse.Club drugs are also sometimes used as "date rape" drugs; to make someone unable to say no to or fight back against sexual assault. Abusing these drugs can cause serious health problems and sometimes death. They are even more dangerous if you use them with alcohol. NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Gastrointestinal Bleeding,https://medlineplus.gov/gastrointestinalbleeding.html,Your digestive or gastrointestinal (GI) tract includes the esophagus; stomach; small intestine; large intestine or colon; rectum; and anus. Bleeding can come from any of these areas. The amount of bleeding can be so small that only a lab test can find it. Signs of bleeding in the digestive tract depend where it is and how much bleeding there is.Signs of bleeding in the upper digestive tract includeBright red blood in vomitVomit that looks like coffee groundsBlack or tarry stoolDark blood mixed with stoolSigns of bleeding in the lower digestive tract includeBlack or tarry stoolDark blood mixed with stoolStool mixed or coated with bright red bloodGI bleeding is not a disease; but a symptom of a disease.

Giant Cell Arteritis,https://medlineplus.gov/giantcellarteritis.html,Giant cell arteritis is a disorder that causes inflammation of your arteries; usually in the scalp; neck; and arms. It narrows the arteries; which keeps blood from flowing well. Giant cell arteritis often occurs with another disorder called polymyalgia rheumatica. Both are more common in women than in men. They almost always affect people over the age of 50.Early symptoms of giant cell arteritis resemble the flu:  fatigue; loss of appetite; and fever. Other symptoms includeHeadachesPain and tenderness over the templesDouble vision or visual loss; dizzinessProblems with coordination and balancePain in your jaw and tongueYour doctor will make the diagnosis based on your medical history; symptoms; and a physical exam. There is no single test to diagnose giant cell arteritis; but you may have tests that measure inflammation.Treatment is usually with corticosteroids. Early treatment is important; otherwise there is a risk of permanent vision loss or stroke.  However; when properly treated; giant cell arteritis rarely comes back.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Giardia Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/giardiainfections.html,Giardiasis is an illness caused by a parasite called Giardia intestinalis. It lives in soil; food; and water. It may also be on surfaces that have been contaminated with waste. You can become infected if you swallow the parasite. You can also get it if you're exposed to human feces (poop) through sexual contact.The risk of getting giardia is higher for travelers to countries where it is common; people in child care settings; and those who drink untreated water.Diarrhea is the main symptom of giardia infection. Others includePassing gasGreasy stoolsStomach crampsUpset stomach or nausea These symptoms may lead to weight loss and loss of body fluids. Some people have no symptoms at all. Symptoms of infection often last two to six weeks. Stool sample tests can diagnose it. You often need to collect several samples to test. Doctors use several drugs to treat it. The best way to prevent giardia infection is to practice good hygiene; including frequent hand washing. You should not drink water that may be contaminated. You should also peel or wash fresh fruit and vegetables before eating.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Liver Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html,Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons.There are many kinds of liver diseases:Diseases caused by  viruses; such as hepatitis A; hepatitis B; and hepatitis CDiseases caused by drugs; poisons; or too much alcohol. Examples include fatty liver disease and cirrhosis.Liver cancerInherited diseases; such as hemochromatosis and Wilson diseaseSymptoms of liver disease can vary; but they often include swelling of the abdomen and legs; bruising easily; changes in the color of your stool and urine; and jaundice; or yellowing of the skin and eyes. Sometimes there are no symptoms. Tests such as imaging tests and liver function tests can check for liver damage and help to diagnose liver diseases.
Infectious Mononucleosis,https://medlineplus.gov/infectiousmononucleosis.html,Infectious mononucleosis; or "mono"; is an infection usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. The virus spreads through saliva; which is why it's sometimes called "kissing disease." Mono occurs most often in teens and young adults. However; you can get it at any age.  Symptoms of mono includeFeverSore throatSwollen lymph glandsSometimes you may also have a swollen spleen.  Serious problems are rare. A blood test can show if you have mono. Most people get better in two to four weeks. However; you may feel tired for a few months afterward. Treatment focuses on helping symptoms and includes medicines for pain and fever; warm salt water gargles and plenty of rest and fluids.
Eye Wear,https://medlineplus.gov/eyewear.html,Eye wear protects or corrects your vision. Examples areSunglassesSafety gogglesGlasses (also called eyeglasses)Contact lensesIf you need corrective lenses; you may be able to choose between contacts or glasses.   Either usually requires a prescription. Almost anyone can wear glasses.  Contact lenses require more careful handling. Many jobs and some sports carry a risk of eye injury. Thousands of children and adults get eye injuries every year. Most are preventable with proper eye protection. Everyone is at risk for eye damage from the sun year-round. It's important to regularly use sunglasses that block out at least 99 percent of UV rays.
Glaucoma,https://medlineplus.gov/glaucoma.html,Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. It usually happens when the fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises; damaging the optic nerve. Often there are no symptoms at first. Without treatment; people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral; or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time; straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains.A comprehensive eye exam can tell if you have glaucoma.  People at risk should get eye exams at least every two years.  They includeAfrican Americans over age 40People over age 60; especially Mexican AmericansPeople with a family history of glaucomaThere is no cure; but glaucoma can usually be controlled. Early treatment can help protect your eyes against vision loss. Treatments usually include prescription eyedrops and/or surgery.NIH: National Eye Institute
Brain Tumors,https://medlineplus.gov/braintumors.html,A brain tumor is a growth of abnormal cells in the tissues of the brain. Brain tumors can be benign; with no cancer cells; or malignant; with cancer cells that grow quickly.  Some are primary brain tumors; which start in the brain. Others are metastatic; and they start somewhere else in the body and move to the brain.Brain tumors can cause many symptoms. Some of the most common areHeadaches; often in the morning Nausea and vomitingChanges in your ability to talk; hear; or seeProblems with balance or walkingProblems with thinking or memory Feeling weak or sleepyChanges in your mood or behaviorSeizuresDoctors diagnose brain tumors by doing a neurologic exam and tests including an MRI; CT scan; and biopsy. Treatment options include watchful waiting; surgery; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. Many people get a combination of treatments.NIH: National Cancer Institute
International Health,https://medlineplus.gov/internationalhealth.html,The spread of a disease doesn't stop at a country's borders.  With more people traveling to other countries and living in crowded cities; it's easier for germs to spread.  Infectious diseases that start in one part of the world can quickly reach another. Resistance to medicines such as antbiotics is on the rise. This makes it harder to treat certain diseases. Natural and man-made disasters create refugee populations with immediate and long-term health problems.Some of the major diseases currently affecting countries around the globe include HIV/AIDS; malaria; Zika; and tuberculosis.  Climate change is also an international problem which can affect people's health. Many countries and health organizations are working together and sharing information on these and other health issues.
Climate Change,https://medlineplus.gov/climatechange.html,Climate is the average weather in a place over a period of time.  Climate change is major change in temperature; rainfall; snow; or wind patterns lasting for many years.  It can be caused by natural factors or by human activities.  Today climate changes are occurring at an increasingly rapid rate.Climate change can affect our health.  It can lead toMore heat-related illness and deathsMore pollen; mold; and air pollution.  This can cause an increase in allergies; asthma; and breathing problems.Mosquitoes and other insects that carry diseases spreading to areas that used to be too cold for them.More floods and rising sea levels.  This can cause an increase in contamination of food and water.More extreme weather events; such as hurricanes and wildfires.

When they form in your joints; it is very painful. The crystals can also cause kidney stones.Often; gout first attacks your big toe. It can also attack ankles; heels; knees; wrists; fingers; and elbows. At first; gout attacks usually get better in days. Eventually; attacks last longer and happen more often.You are more likely to get gout if youAre a manHave family member with goutAre overweightDrink alcoholEat too many foods rich in purinesGout can be hard to diagnose. Your doctor may take a sample of fluid from an inflamed joint to look for crystals. You can treat gout with medicines.Pseudogout has similar symptoms and is sometimes confused with gout.  However; it is caused by calcium phosphate; not uric acid.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases

It can affect any organ; but it mainly affects the sinuses; nose; trachea (windpipe); lungs; and kidneys. The cause of GPA is unknown.  It can affect people at any age. Men and women are equally affected. It is more common in whites. Symptoms may include joint pain; weakness; tiredness; and cold symptoms such as a runny nose that doesn't get better. Doctors use blood tests; chest X-rays; and biopsies to diagnose GPA and rule out other causes of the symptoms.Early treatment is important. Most people improve with medicines to slow or stop the inflammation. NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Hyperthyroidism,https://medlineplus.gov/hyperthyroidism.html,Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck; just above your collarbone. It is one of your endocrine glands; which make hormones. Thyroid hormones control the rate of many activities in your body. These include how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats.

Growth disorders are problems that prevent children from developing normal height; weight; sexual maturity or other features.Very slow or very fast growth can sometimes signal a gland problem or disease.The pituitary gland makes growth hormone; which stimulates the growth of bone and other tissues. Children who have too little of it may be very short. Treatment with growth hormone can stimulate growth.People can also have too much growth hormone.  Usually the cause is a pituitary gland tumor; which is not cancer.  Too much growth hormone can cause gigantism in children; where their bones and their body grow too much.  In adults; it can cause acromegaly; which makes the hands; feet and face larger than normal. Possible treatments include surgery to remove the tumor; medicines; and radiation therapy.
Guide to Good Posture,https://medlineplus.gov/guidetogoodposture.html,Good posture is about more than standing up straight so you can look your best. It is an important part of your long-term health. Making sure that you hold your body the right way; whether you are moving or still; can prevent pain; injuries; and other health problems.What is posture?Posture is how you hold your body.

The first symptom is usually weakness or a tingling feeling in your legs. The feeling can spread to your upper body. In severe cases; you become almost paralyzed. This is life-threatening. You might need a respirator to breathe. Symptoms usually worsen over a period of weeks and then stabilize. Guillain-Barre can be hard to diagnose.  Possible tests include nerve tests and a spinal tap. Most people recover. Recovery can take a few weeks to a few years. Treatment can help symptoms; and may include medicines or a procedure called plasma exchange.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

They invade living; normal cells and use those cells to multiply and produce other viruses like themselves. This can kill; damage; or change the cells and make you sick. Different viruses attack certain cells in your body such as your liver; respiratory system; or blood.When you get a virus; you may not always get sick from it. Your immune system may be able to fight it off.For most viral infections; treatments can only help with symptoms while you wait for your immune system to fight off the virus. Antibiotics do not work for viral infections. There are antiviral medicines to treat some viral infections. Vaccines can help prevent you from getting many viral diseases.
Germs and Hygiene,https://medlineplus.gov/germsandhygiene.html,When you cough or sneeze; you send tiny germ-filled droplets into the air.  Colds and flu usually spread that way. You can help stop the spread of germs byCovering your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough. Sneeze or cough into your elbow; not your hands.Cleaning your hands often - always before you eat or prepare food; and after you use the bathroom or change a diaper Avoiding touching your eyes; nose or mouthHand washing is one of the most effective and most overlooked ways to stop disease. Soap and water work well to kill germs. Wash for at least 20 seconds and rub your hands briskly.  Disposable hand wipes or gel sanitizers also work well.
Mycobacterial Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/mycobacterialinfections.html,Mycobacteria are a type of germ. There are many different kinds. The most common one causes tuberculosis. Another one causes leprosy. Still others cause infections that are called atypical mycobacterial infections.  They aren't "typical" because they don't cause tuberculosis. But they can still harm people; especially people with other problems that affect their immunity; such as AIDS. Sometimes you can have these infections with no symptoms at all. At other times; they can cause lung symptoms similar to tuberculosis:  Cough Weight loss Coughing up blood or mucus Weakness or fatigue Fever and chills Night sweats Lack of appetite and weight loss  Medicines can treat these infections; but often more than one is needed to cure the infection.
Hantavirus Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/hantavirusinfections.html,Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a rare but deadly viral infection. It is spread by mice and rats. They shed the virus in their urine; droppings; and saliva. Tiny droplets with the virus can enter the air. People can get the disease if they breathe infected air or come into contact with rodents or their urine or droppings. You cannot catch it from people.Early symptoms of HPS includeFatigueFever Muscle aches; especially in the thighs; hips and backHeadachesChillsDizzinessNausea; vomiting; diarrhea or abdominal painLater symptoms include coughing and shortness of breath. Controlling rodents in and around your house is the best way to prevent infection. If you have been around rodents and have symptoms of fever; deep muscle aches; and severe shortness of breath; see your doctor immediately.There is no specific treatment; cure; or vaccine for HPS. Patients may do better if it is recognized early and they get medical care in an intensive care unit. They often need to use a breathing machine and have oxygen therapy.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Atherosclerosis,https://medlineplus.gov/atherosclerosis.html,Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Plaque is a sticky substance made up of fat; cholesterol; calcium; and other substances found in the blood. Over time; plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. That limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body.Atherosclerosis can lead to serious problems; includingCoronary artery disease. These arteries supply blood to your heart. When they are blocked; you can suffer angina or a heart attack.Carotid artery disease. These arteries supply blood to your brain. When they are blocked you can suffer a stroke.Peripheral arterial disease. These arteries are in your arms; legs and pelvis. When they are blocked; you can suffer from numbness; pain and sometimes infections.Atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause symptoms until it severely narrows or totally blocks an artery. Many people don't know they have it until they have a medical emergency.A physical exam; imaging; and other diagnostic tests can tell if you have it. Medicines can slow the progress of plaque buildup. Your doctor may also recommend procedures such as angioplasty to open the arteries; or surgery on the coronary or carotid arteries. Lifestyle changes can also help. These include following a healthy diet; getting regular exercise; maintaining a healthy weight; quitting smoking; and managing stress. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Hypothyroidism,https://medlineplus.gov/hypothyroidism.html,Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck; just above your collarbone. It is one of your endocrine glands; which make hormones. Thyroid hormones control the rate of many activities in your body. These include how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats. All of these activities are your body's metabolism.  If your thyroid gland is not active enough; it does not make enough thyroid hormone to meet your body's needs. This condition is hypothyroidism.Hypothyroidism is more common in women; people with other thyroid problems; and those over 60 years old. Hashimoto's disease; an autoimmune disorder; is the most common cause.  Other causes include thyroid nodules; thyroiditis; congenital hypothyroidism; surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid; radiation treatment of the thyroid; and some medicines.The symptoms can vary from person to person.  They may includeFatigueWeight gainA puffy faceCold intoleranceJoint and muscle painConstipationDry skinDry; thinning hairDecreased sweatingHeavy or irregular menstrual periods and fertility problemsDepressionSlowed heart rateTo diagnose hypothyroidism; your doctor will do a physical exam; look at your symptoms; and do thyroid tests. Treatment is with synthetic thyroid hormone; taken every day.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Hay Fever,https://medlineplus.gov/hayfever.html,Each spring; summer; and fall; trees; weeds; and grasses release tiny pollen grains into the air. Some of the pollen ends up in your nose and throat. This can trigger a type of allergy called hay fever.Symptoms can includeSneezing; often with a runny or clogged noseCoughing and postnasal dripItching eyes; nose and throatRed and watery eyesDark circles under the eyesYour health care provider may diagnose hay fever based on a physical exam and your symptoms. Sometimes skin or blood tests are used. Taking medicines and using nasal sprays can relieve symptoms. You can also rinse out your nose; but be sure to use distilled or sterilized water with saline. Allergy shots can help make you less sensitive to pollen and provide long-term relief.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Hazardous Waste,https://medlineplus.gov/hazardouswaste.html,Even if you use them properly; many chemicals can still harm human health and the environment. When you throw these substances away; they become hazardous waste.  Some hazardous wastes come from products in our homes. Our garbage can include such hazardous wastes as old batteries; bug spray cans and paint thinner. U.S. residents generate 1.6 million tons of household hazardous waste per year. Hazardous waste is also a by-product of manufacturing. You may have hazardous wastes in your basement or garage. How do you get rid of them? Don't pour them down the drain; flush them; or put them in the garbage. See if you can donate or recycle. Many communities have household hazardous waste collection programs.  Check to see if there is one in your area.Environmental Protection Agency
Cholesterol,https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterol.html,Cholesterol is a waxy; fat-like substance that occurs naturally in all parts of the body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much in your blood; it can combine with other substances in the blood and stick to the walls of your arteries. This is called plaque. Plaque can narrow your arteries or even block them.High levels of cholesterol in the blood can increase your risk of heart disease. Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older. There are usually no signs or symptoms that you have high blood cholesterol; but it can be detected with a blood test. You are likely to have high cholesterol if members of your family have it; if you are overweight or if you eat a lot of fatty foods.You can lower your cholesterol by exercising more and eating more fruits and vegetables. You also may need to take medicine to lower your cholesterol.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Head and Neck Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/headandneckcancer.html,Head and neck cancer includes cancers of the mouth; nose; sinuses; salivary glands; throat; and lymph nodes in the neck. Most begin in the moist tissues that line the mouth; nose; and throat. Symptoms includeA lump or sore that does not healA sore throat that does not go awayTrouble swallowingA change or hoarseness in the voiceHead and neck cancers are twice as common in men. Using tobacco or alcohol increases your risk. In fact; around 75 percent of head and neck cancers are linked to tobacco use; including smoking and smokeless tobacco. Infection with HPV is a risk factor for some head and neck cancers. To diagnose head and neck cancer; your doctor will do a physical exam and diagnostic tests. You will have a biopsy; where a sample of tissue is taken out and examined under a microscope. It is the only test that can tell for sure if you have cancer.If found early; these cancers are often curable. Treatments may include surgery; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; or a combination. Treatments can affect eating; speaking or even breathing; so patients may need rehabilitation.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Head Injuries,https://medlineplus.gov/headinjuries.html,Chances are you've bumped your head before.  Often; the injury is minor because your skull is hard and it protects your brain.  But other head injuries can be more severe; such as a skull fracture; concussion; or traumatic brain injury.Head injuries can be open or closed.  A closed injury does not break through the skull.  With an open; or penetrating; injury; an object pierces the skull and enters the brain.  Closed injuries are not always less severe than open injuries.Some common causes of head injuries are falls; motor vehicle accidents; violence; and sports injuries.It is important to know the warning signs of a moderate or severe head injury.  Get help immediately if the injured person hasA headache that gets worse or does not go awayRepeated vomiting or nauseaConvulsions or seizuresAn inability to wake upDilated (enlarged) pupil in one or both eyesSlurred speechWeakness or numbness in the arms or legsLoss of coordinationIncreased confusion; restlessness; or agitationDoctors use a neurologic exam and imaging tests to make a diagnosis. Treatment depends on the type of injury and how severe it is.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Head Lice,https://medlineplus.gov/headlice.html,Head lice are parasitic wingless insects. They live on people's heads and feed on their blood. An adult louse is about the size of a sesame seed. The eggs; called nits; are even smaller - about the size of a knot in thread. Lice and nits are found on or near the scalp; most often at the neckline and behind the ears.Lice spread by close person-to-person contact. It is possible; but not common; to get lice by sharing personal belongings such as hats or hairbrushes.  Children ages 3-11 and their families get head lice most often. Personal hygiene has nothing to do with getting head lice. Head lice do not spread disease.Symptoms are Tickling feeling in the hairFrequent itchingSores from scratchingIrritability and difficulty sleeping. Head lice are most active in the dark.Treatment is recommended for people who have an active infestation of head lice. All household members and other close contacts should be checked and treated if necessary.  Some experts also recommend treating anyone who shares a bed with an infested person. It is important to treat everyone at the same time.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Headache,https://medlineplus.gov/headache.html,Almost everyone has had a headache. Headache is the most common form of pain. It's a major reason people miss days at work or school or visit the doctor.The most common type of headache is a tension headache. Tension headaches are due to tight muscles in your shoulders; neck; scalp and jaw. They are often related to stress; depression or anxiety. You are more likely to get tension headaches if you work too much; don't get enough sleep; miss meals; or use alcohol.Other common types of headaches include migraines; cluster headaches; and sinus headaches. Most people can feel much better by making lifestyle changes; learning ways to relax and taking pain relievers.Not all headaches require a doctor's attention. But sometimes headaches warn of a more serious disorder. Let your health care provider know if you have sudden; severe headaches. Get medical help right away if you have a headache after a blow to your head; or if you have a headache along with a stiff neck; fever; confusion; loss of consciousness; or pain in the eye or ear.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Health Checkup,https://medlineplus.gov/healthcheckup.html,Regular health exams and tests can help find problems before they start. They also can help find problems early; when your chances for treatment and cure are better. Which exams and screenings you need depends on your age; health and family history; and lifestyle choices such as what you eat; how active you are; and whether you smoke. To make the most of your next check-up; here are some things to do before you go:  Review your family health history Find out if you are due for any general screenings or vaccinations Write down a list of issues and questions to take with you  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Health Disparities,https://medlineplus.gov/healthdisparities.html,Health disparities refer to differences in the health status of different groups of people.

Some facilities do a better job than others. One way to learn about the quality of a facility is to look at report cards developed by federal; state; and consumer groups.
Health Fraud,https://medlineplus.gov/healthfraud.html,Health fraud involves selling drugs; devices; foods; or cosmetics that have not been proven effective. Keep in mind - if it sounds too good to be true; it's probably a scam. At best; these scams don't work. At worst; they're dangerous. They also waste money; and they might keep you from getting the treatment you really need.Health fraud scams can be found everywhere; promising help for many common health issues; including weight loss; memory loss; sexual performance; and joint pain. They target people with serious conditions like cancer; diabetes; heart disease; HIV/AIDS; arthritis; Alzheimer's; and many more.To protect yourself; recognize the red flags such as:Miracle cureQuick fixAncient remedySecret ingredientScientific breakthroughBefore taking an unproven or little known treatment; talk to a doctor or health care professional - especially when taking prescription drugs.Food and Drug Administration
Health Insurance,https://medlineplus.gov/healthinsurance.html,Health insurance helps protect you from high medical care costs. It is a contract between you and your insurance company. You buy a plan or policy; and the company agrees to pay part of your expenses when you need medical care.Many people in the United States get a health insurance policy through their employers. In most cases; the employer helps pay for that insurance. Insurance through employers is often with a managed care plan. These plans contract with health care providers and medical facilities to provide care for members at reduced costs. You can also purchase health insurance on your own.People who meet certain requirements can qualify for government health insurance; such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act expands health insurance coverage for many people in the U.S.
Health Literacy,https://medlineplus.gov/healthliteracy.html,Health literacy refers to how well a person can get the health information and services that they need; and how well they understand them. It is also about using them to make good health decisions.  It involves differences that people have in areas such asAccess to information that they can understandSkills; such as finding that information; communicating with health care providers; living a healthy lifestyle; and managing a diseaseKnowledge of medical words; and of how their health care system worksAbilities; such as physical or mental limitationsPersonal factors; such as age; education; language abilities; and cultureMore than 90 million adults in the United States have low health literacy. It affects their ability to make health decisions. This can harm their health. They may have trouble managing chronic diseases; and leading a healthy lifestyle. They may go to the hospital more often; and have poorer health overall.NIH: National Institutes of Health
Managed Care,https://medlineplus.gov/managedcare.html,Managed care plans are a type of health insurance. They have contracts with health care providers and medical facilities to provide care for members at reduced costs. These providers make up the plan's network. How much of your care the plan will pay for depends on the network's rules.Plans that restrict your choices usually cost you less. If you want a flexible plan; it will probably cost more. There are three types of managed care plans:Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) usually only pay for care within the network. You choose a primary care doctor who coordinates most of your care.Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO) usually pay more if you get care within the network. They still pay part of the cost if you go outside the network.Point of Service (POS) plans let you choose between an HMO or a PPO each time you need care.
Health Occupations,https://medlineplus.gov/healthoccupations.html,Every day; around the clock; people who work in the health care industry provide care for millions of people; from newborns to the very ill. In fact; the health care industry is one of largest providers of jobs in the United States. Many health jobs are in hospitals.

Call your health care provider if something is bothering or worrying you.
Health Risks of an Inactive Lifestyle,https://medlineplus.gov/healthrisksofaninactivelifestyle.html,What is an inactive lifestyle?Being a couch potato. Not exercising. A sedentary or inactive lifestyle. You have probably heard of all of these phrases; and they mean the same thing: a lifestyle with a lot of sitting and lying down; with very little to no exercise.In the United States and around the world; people are spending more and more time doing sedentary activities. During our leisure time; we are often sitting: while using a computer or other device; watching TV; or playing video games.

These are all types of health statistics.Health statistics are numbers about some aspect of health. Statistics about births; deaths; marriages; and divorces are sometimes called "vital statistics." Researchers use statistics to see patterns of diseases in groups of people. This can help in figuring out who is at risk for certain diseases; finding ways to control diseases and deciding which diseases should be studied.
Healthy Aging,https://medlineplus.gov/healthyaging.html,People in the U.S. are living longer than ever before. Many seniors live active and healthy lives.

Healthy Sleep,https://medlineplus.gov/healthysleep.html,What is sleep?While you are sleeping; you are unconscious; but your brain and body functions are still active. Sleep is a complex biological process that helps you process new information; stay healthy; and feel rested.During sleep; your brain cycles through five stages: stage 1; 2; 3; 4; and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Different things happen during each stage. For example; you have a different pattern of brain waves during each one. Your breathing; heart; and temperature may be slower or faster in some stages. Certain phases of sleep help you Feel rested and energetic the next dayLearn information; get insight; and form memoriesGive your heart and vascular system a restRelease more growth hormone; which helps children grow. It also boosts muscle mass and the repair of cells and tissues in children and adults.Release sex hormones; which contributes to puberty and fertilityKeep from getting sick or help you get better when you are sick; by creating more cytokines (hormones that help the immune system fight various infections)You need all of the stages to get a healthy sleep.How much sleep do I need?The amount of sleep you need depends on several factors; including your age; lifestyle; health; and whether you have been getting enough sleep recently. The general recommendations for sleep areNewborns: 16-18 hours a dayPreschool-aged children: 11-12 hours a daySchool-aged children: At least 10 hours a dayTeens: 9-10 hours a dayAdults (including the elderly): 7-8 hours a dayDuring puberty; teenagers' biological clocks shift; and they are more likely to go to bed later than younger children and adults; and they tend to want to sleep later in the morning. This delayed sleep-wake rhythm conflicts with the early-morning start times of many high schools and helps explain why most teenagers do not get enough sleep.Some people think that adults need less sleep as they age. But there is no evidence to show that seniors can get by with less sleep than people who are younger. As people age; however; they often get less sleep or they tend to spend less time in the deep; restful stage of sleep. Older people are also more easily awakened.And it's not just the number of hours of sleep you get that matters. The quality of the sleep you get is also important. People whose sleep is frequently interrupted or cut short might not get enough of certain stages of sleep.If you are wondering whether you are getting enough sleep; including quality sleep; ask yourselfDo you have trouble getting up in the morning?Do you have trouble focusing during the day?Do you doze off during the day?If you answered yes to these three questions; you should work on improving your sleep.What are the health effects of not getting enough sleep?Sleep is important for overall health. When you don't get enough sleep (sleep deprivation); it does more than just make you feel tired. It can affect your performance; including your ability to think clearly; react quickly; and form memories. This may cause you to make bad decisions and take more risks. People with sleep deprivation are more likely to get into accidents.Sleep deprivation can also affect your mood; leading toIrritabilityProblems with relationships; especially for children and teenagersDepressionAnxietyIt can also affect your physical health. Research shows that not getting enough sleep; or getting poor-quality sleep; increases your risk ofHigh blood pressureHeart diseaseStrokeKidney diseaseObesityType 2 diabetesNot getting enough sleep can also mean that you don't get enough of the hormones that help children grow and help adults and children build muscle mass; fight infections; and repair cells.Sleep deprivation magnifies the effect of alcohol. A tired person who drinks too much alcohol will be more impaired than a well-rested person.How can I get better sleep?You can take steps to improve your sleep habits. First; make sure that you allow yourself enough time to sleep. With enough sleep each night; you may find that you're happier and more productive during the day.To improve your sleep habits; it also may help toGo to bed and wake up at the same time every dayAvoid caffeine; especially in the afternoon and eveningAvoid nicotineExercise regularly; but don't exercise too late in the dayAvoid alcoholic drinks before bedAvoid large meals and beverages late at nightDon't take a nap after 3 p.m.Relax before bed; for example by taking a bath; reading or listening to relaxing musicKeep the temperature in your bedroom coolGet rid of distractions such as noises; bright lights; and a TV or computer in the bedroom. Also; don't be tempted to go on your phone or tablet just before bed.Get enough sunlight exposure during the dayDon't lie in bed awake; if you can't sleep for 20 minutes; get up and do something relaxingSee a doctor if you have continued trouble sleeping. You may have a sleep disorder; such as insomnia or sleep apnea.  In some cases; your doctor may suggest trying over-the-counter or prescription sleep aid. In other cases; your doctor may want you to do a sleep study; to help diagnose the problem.If you are a shift worker; it can be even harder to get a good sleep. You may also want toTake naps and increase the amount of time available for sleepKeep the lights bright at workLimit shift changes so your body clock can adjustLimit caffeine use to the first part of your shiftRemove sound and light distractions in your bedroom during daytime sleep (for example; use light-blocking curtains)
Hearing Aids,https://medlineplus.gov/hearingaids.html,A hearing aid is a small electronic device that you wear in or behind your ear.  It makes some sounds louder.   A hearing aid can help people hear more in both quiet and noisy situations. Hearing aids help people who have hearing loss from damage to the small sensory cells in the inner ear. The damage can occur as a result of disease; aging; or injury from noise or certain medicines. Only about one out of five people who would benefit from a hearing aid actually uses one. If you think a hearing aid could help you; visit your doctor. There are different kinds of hearing aids.  They differ by size; their placement on or inside the ear; and how much they amplify sound.  The hearing aid that will work best for you depends on what kind of hearing loss you have; and how severe it is.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Hearing Disorders and Deafness,https://medlineplus.gov/hearingdisordersanddeafness.html,It's frustrating to be unable to hear well enough to enjoy talking with friends or family. Hearing disorders make it hard; but not impossible; to hear. They can often be helped. Deafness can keep you from hearing sound at all. What causes hearing loss? Some possibilities areHeredityDiseases such as ear infections and meningitis TraumaCertain medicinesLong-term exposure to loud noiseAgingThere are two main types of hearing loss. One happens when your inner ear or auditory nerve is damaged. This type is usually permanent. The other kind happens when sound waves cannot reach your inner ear. Earwax build-up; fluid; or a punctured eardrum can cause it. Treatment or surgery can often reverse this kind of hearing loss.Untreated; hearing problems can get worse. If you have trouble hearing; you can get help. Possible treatments include hearing aids; cochlear implants; special training; certain medicines; and surgery.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Hearing Problems in Children,https://medlineplus.gov/hearingproblemsinchildren.html,Most children hear and listen from the moment they are born. They learn to talk by imitating the sounds around them and the voices of their parents and caregivers. But about 2 or 3 out of every 1;000 children in the United States are born deaf or hard-of-hearing. More lose their hearing later during childhood.Babies should have a hearing screening before they are a month old. If your child has a hearing loss; it is important to consider the use of hearing devices and other communication options by age 6 months. That's because children start learning speech and language long before they talk.Hearing problems can be temporary or permanent. Sometimes; ear infections; injuries or diseases affect hearing. If your child does not hear well; get help.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Heart Attack,https://medlineplus.gov/heartattack.html,Each year almost 800;000 Americans have a heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart suddenly becomes blocked. Without the blood coming in; the heart can't get oxygen. If not treated quickly; the heart muscle begins to die. But if you do get quick treatment; you may be able prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. That's why it's important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 9-1-1 if you or someone else is having them. You should call; even if you are not sure that it is a heart attack.The most common symptoms in men and women areChest discomfort. It is often in center or left side of the chest. It usually lasts more than a few minutes. It may go away and come back. It can feel like pressure; squeezing; fullness; or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion.Shortness of breath. Sometimes this is your only symptom. You may get it before or during the chest discomfort. It can happen when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.Discomfort in the upper body. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms; the back; shoulders; neck; jaw; or upper part of the stomach.You may also have other symptoms; such as nausea; vomiting; dizziness; and lightheadedness. You may break out in a cold sweat. Sometimes women will have different symptoms then men. For example; they are more likely to feel tired for no reason.The most common cause of heart attacks is coronary artery disease (CAD). With CAD; there is a buildup of cholesterol and other material; called plaque; on their inner walls or the arteries. This is atherosclerosis. It can build up for years. Eventually an area of plaque can rupture (break open). A blood clot can form around the plaque and block the artery.A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery.At the hospital; health care providers make a diagnosis based on your symptoms; blood tests; and different heart health tests. Treatments may include medicines and medical procedures such as coronary angioplasty. After a heart attack; cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle changes can help you recover.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Congenital Heart Defects,https://medlineplus.gov/congenitalheartdefects.html,A congenital heart defect is a problem with the structure of the heart. It is present at birth. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect. The defects can involve the walls of the heart; the valves of the heart; and the arteries and veins near the heart. They can disrupt the normal flow of blood through the heart. The blood flow can slow down; go in the wrong direction or to the wrong place; or be blocked completely.Doctors use a physical exam and special heart tests to diagnose congenital heart defects. They often find severe defects during pregnancy or soon after birth. Signs and symptoms of severe defects in newborns includeRapid breathingCyanosis - a bluish tint to the skin; lips; and fingernailsFatiguePoor blood circulationMany congenital heart defects cause few or no signs and symptoms. They are often not diagnosed until children are older.Many children with congenital heart defects don't need treatment; but others do. Treatment can include medicines; catheter procedures; surgery; and heart transplants. The treatment depends on the type of the defect; how severe it is; and a child's age; size; and general health.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Heart Disease in Women,https://medlineplus.gov/heartdiseaseinwomen.html,In the United States; 1 in 4 women dies from heart disease. The most common cause of heart disease in both men and women is narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries; the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart itself. This is called coronary artery disease; and it happens slowly over time. It's the major reason people have heart attacks.Heart diseases that affect women more than men includeCoronary microvascular disease (MVD) - a problem that affects the heart's tiny arteriesBroken heart syndrome - extreme emotional stress leading to severe but often short-term heart muscle failureThe older a woman gets; the more likely she is to get heart disease. But women of all ages should be concerned about heart disease. All women can take steps to prevent  it by practicing healthy lifestyle habits. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
How to Prevent Heart Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventheartdisease.html,Heart disease is the leading cause of the death in the United States. It is also a major cause of disability. There are many things that can raise your risk for heart disease. They are called risk factors. Some of them you cannot control; but there are many that you can control. Learning about them can lower your risk of heart disease.What are the heart disease risk factors that I cannot change?Age. Your risk of heart disease increases as you get older. Men age 45 and older and women age 55 and older have a greater risk.Gender. Some risk factors may affect heart disease risk differently in women than in men. For example; estrogen provides women some protection against heart disease; but diabetes raises the risk of heart disease more in women than in men.Race or ethnicity. Certain groups have higher risks than others. African Americans are more likely than whites to have heart disease; while Hispanic Americans are less likely to have it. Some Asian groups; such as East Asians; have lower rates; but South Asians have higher rates.Family history. You have a greater risk if you have a close family member who had heart disease at an early age.What can I do to lower my risk of heart disease?Fortunately; there are many things you can do to reduce your chances of getting heart disease:Control your blood pressure. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease. It is important to get your blood pressure checked regularly - at least once a year for most adults; and more often if you have high blood pressure. Take steps; including lifestyle changes; to prevent or control high blood pressure.Keep your cholesterol and triglyceride levels under control. High levels of cholesterol can clog your arteries and raise your risk of coronary artery disease and heart attack. Triglycerides are another type of fat in the blood. High  levels of triglycerides may also raise the risk of coronary artery disease; especially in women.Stay at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity can increase your risk for heart disease. This is mostly because they are linked to other heart disease risk factors; including high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels; high blood pressure; and diabetes. Controlling your weight can lower these risks.Eat a healthy diet. Try to limit saturated fats; foods high in sodium; and added sugars. Eat plenty of fresh fruit; vegetables; and whole grains. The DASH diet is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol; two things that can lower your risk of heart disease.Get regular exercise. Exercise has many benefits; including strengthening your heart and improving your circulation. It can also help you maintain a healthy weight and lower cholesterol and blood pressure. All of these can lower your risk of heart disease.Limit alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories; which may cause weight gain. Both of those raise your risk of heart disease. Men should have no more than two alcoholic drinks per day; and women should not have more than one.Don't smoke. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke; do not start. If you do smoke; quitting will lower your risk for heart disease. You can talk with your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.Manage stress. Stress is linked to heart disease in many ways. It can raise your blood pressure. Extreme stress can be a "trigger" for a heart attack. Also; some common ways of coping with stress; such as overeating; heavy drinking; and smoking; are bad for your heart. Some ways to help manage your stress include exercise; listening to music; focusing on something calm or peaceful; and meditating.Manage diabetes. Having diabetes doubles your risk of diabetic heart disease. That is because over time; high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. So; it is important to get tested for diabetes; and if you have it; to keep it under control.Make sure that you get enough sleep. If you don't get enough sleep; you raise your risk of high blood pressure; obesity; and diabetes. Those three things can raise your risk for heart disease. Most adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. Make sure that you have good sleep habits. If you have frequent sleep problems; contact your health care provider. One problem; sleep apnea; causes people to briefly stop breathing many times during sleep. This interferes with your ability to get a good rest and can raise your risk of heart disease. If you think you might have it; ask your doctor about having a sleep study. And if you do have sleep apnea; make sure that you get treatment for it.
Heart Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/heartdiseases.html,If you're like most people; you think that heart disease is a problem for others. But heart disease is the number one killer in the U.S. It is also a major cause of disability. There are many different forms of heart disease. The most common cause of heart disease is narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries; the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart itself. This is called coronary artery disease and happens slowly over time. It's the major reason people have heart attacks. Other kinds of heart problems may happen to the valves in the heart; or the heart may not pump well and cause heart failure. Some people are born with heart disease.You can help reduce your risk of heart disease by taking steps to control factors that put you at greater risk: Control your blood pressure Lower your cholesterol Don't smoke Get enough exerciseNIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

Cardiac Rehabilitation,https://medlineplus.gov/cardiacrehabilitation.html,Cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) is a medically supervised program to help people who haveA heart attackAngioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting for coronary heart diseaseA heart valve repair or replacementA heart transplant or a lung transplantAnginaHeart failureThe goal is to help you return to an active life; and to reduce the risk of further heart problems.  A team of specialists will create a plan for you that includes exercise training; education on heart healthy living; and counseling to reduce stress.  You will learn how to reduce your risk factors; such as high blood pressure; high blood cholesterol; depression; and diabetes. Being overweight; having obesity; smoking; and not exercising are other risk factors. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Heart Failure,https://medlineplus.gov/heartfailure.html,Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Heart failure does not mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. It means that your heart is not able to pump blood the way it should. It can affect one or both sides of the heart.The weakening of the heart's pumping ability causesBlood and fluid to back up into the lungsThe buildup of fluid in the feet; ankles and legs - called edemaTiredness and shortness of breathCommon causes of heart failure are coronary artery disease; high blood pressure and diabetes. It is more common in people who are 65 years old or older; African Americans; people who are overweight; and people who have had a heart attack. Men have a higher rate of heart failure than women.Your doctor will diagnose heart failure by doing a physical exam and heart tests. Treatment includes treating the underlying cause of your heart failure; medicines; and heart transplantation if other treatments fail.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Heart Health Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/hearthealthtests.html,Heart diseases are the number one killer in the U.S. They are also a major cause of disability. If you do have a heart disease; it is important to find it early; when it is easier to treat. Blood tests and heart health tests can help find heart diseases or identify problems that can lead to heart diseases. There are several different types of heart health tests. Your doctor will decide which test or tests you need; based on your symptoms (if any); risk factors; and medical history.Cardiac CatheterizationCardiac catheterization is a medical procedure used to diagnose and treat some heart conditions. For the procedure; your doctor puts a catheter (a long; thin; flexible tube) into a blood vessel in your arm; groin; or neck; and threads it to your heart. The doctor can use the catheter toDo a coronary angiography. This involves putting a special type of dye in the catheter; so the dye can flow through your bloodstream to your heart. Then your doctor takes x-rays of your heart. The dye allows your doctor to see your coronary arteries on the x-ray; and to check for coronary artery disease (plaque buildup in the arteries).Take samples of blood and heart muscleDo procedures such as minor heart surgery or angioplasty; if your doctor finds that you need itCardiac CT ScanA cardiac CT (computed tomography) scan is a painless imaging test that uses x-rays to take detailed pictures of your heart and its blood vessels. Computers can combine these pictures to create a three-dimensional (3D) model of the whole heart. This test can help doctors detect or evaluateCoronary artery diseaseCalcium buildup in the coronary arteriesProblems with the aortaProblems with heart function and valvesPericardial diseasesBefore you have the test; you get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures. The CT scanner is a large; tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table which slides you into the scanner; and the scanner takes the pictures for about 15 minutes.Cardiac MRICardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a painless imaging test that uses radio waves; magnets; and a computer to create detailed pictures of your heart. It can help your doctor figure out whether you have heart disease; and if so; how severe it is. A cardiac MRI can also help your doctor decide the best way to treat heart problems such asCoronary artery diseaseHeart valve problemsPericarditisCardiac tumorsDamage from a heart attackThe MRI is a large; tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table which slides you into the MRI machine. The machine makes loud noises as it takes pictures of your heart. It usually takes about 30-90 minutes. Sometimes before the test; you might get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures.Chest X-RayA chest x-ray creates pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest; such as your heart; lungs; and blood vessels. It can reveal signs of heart failure; as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to heart disease.Coronary AngiographyCoronary angiography (angiogram) is a procedure that uses contrast dye and x-ray pictures to look at the insides of your arteries. It can show whether plaque is blocking your arteries and how severe the blockage is. Doctors use this procedure to diagnose heart diseases after chest pain; sudden cardiac arrest; or abnormal results from other heart tests such as an EKG or a stress test.You usually have a cardiac catheterization to get the dye into your coronary arteries. Then you have special x-rays while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels.EchocardiographyEchocardiography; or echo; is a painless test that uses sound waves to create moving pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart. They also show how well your heart's chambers and valves are working. Doctors use an echo to diagnose many different heart problems; and to check how severe they are.For the test; a technician applies gel to your chest. The gel helps sound waves reach your heart. The technician moves a transducer (wand-like device) around on your chest. The transducer connects to a computer. It transmits ultrasound waves into your chest; and the waves bounce (echo) back. The computer converts the echoes into pictures of your heart.Electrocardiogram (EKG); (ECG)An electrocardiogram; also called an ECG or EKG; is a painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. It shows how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is steady or irregular.An EKG may be part of a routine exam to screen for heart disease. Or you may get it to detect and study heart problems such as heart attacks; arrhythmia; and heart failure.For the test; you lie still on a table and a nurse or technician attaches electrodes (patches that have sensors) to the skin on your chest; arms; and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a machine that records your heart's electrical activity.Stress TestingStress testing looks at how your heart works during physical stress. It can help to diagnose coronary artery disease; and to check how severe it is. It can also check for other problems; including heart valve disease and heart failure.For the test; you exercise (or are given medicine if you are unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast. While this is happening; you get an EKG and blood pressure monitoring. Sometimes you may also have an echocardiogram; or other imaging tests such as a nuclear scan. For the nuclear scan; you get an injection of a tracer (a radioactive substance); which travels to your heart. Special cameras detect the energy from the tracer to make pictures of your heart. You have pictures taken after you exercise; and then after you rest.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

Heart Valve Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/heartvalvediseases.html,Your heart has four valves. Normally; these valves open to let blood flow through or out of your heart; and then shut to keep it from flowing backward. But sometimes they don't work properly. If they don't; you could haveRegurgitation - when blood leaks back through the valve in the wrong directionMitral valve prolapse - when one of the valves; the mitral valve; has "floppy" flaps and doesn't close tightly. It's one of the most common heart valve conditions. Sometimes it causes regurgitation.Stenosis - when the valve doesn't open enough and blocks blood flowValve problems can be present at birth or caused by infections; heart attacks; or heart disease or damage. The main sign of heart valve disease is an unusual heartbeat sound called a heart murmur. Your doctor can hear a heart murmur with a stethoscope. But many people have heart murmurs without having a problem. Heart tests can show if you have a heart valve disease. Some valve problems are minor and do not need treatment. Others might require medicine; medical procedures; or surgery to repair or replace the valve.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Vital Signs,https://medlineplus.gov/vitalsigns.html,Your vital signs show how well your body is functioning. They are usually measured at doctor's offices; often as part of a health checkup; or during an emergency room visit. They includeBlood pressure; which measures the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Blood pressure that is too high or too low can cause problems. Your blood pressure has two numbers. The first number is the pressure when your heart beats and is pumping the blood.  The second is from when your heart is at rest; between beats. A normal blood pressure reading for adults is lower than 120/80 and higher than 90/60.Heart rate; or pulse; which measures how fast your heart is beating. A problem with your heart rate may be an arrhythmia. Your normal heart rate depends on factors such as your age; how much you exercise; whether you are sitting or standing; which medicines you take; and your weight.Respiratory rate; which measures your breathing. Mild breathing changes can be from causes such as a stuffy nose or hard exercise. But slow or fast breathing can also be a sign of a serious breathing problem.Temperature; which measures how hot your body is. A body temperature that is higher than normal (over 98.6 degrees F) is called a fever.
Heart Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/heartsurgery.html,Heart surgery can correct problems with the heart if other treatments haven't worked or can't be used. The most common type of heart surgery for adults is coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). During CABG; a healthy artery or vein from the body is connected; or grafted; to a blocked coronary (heart) artery.Doctors also use heart surgery toRepair or replace heart valves; which control blood flow through the heartRepair abnormal or damaged structures in the heartImplant medical devices that help control the heartbeat or support heart function and blood flowReplace a damaged heart with a healthy heart from a donorTreat heart failure and coronary heart disease Control abnormal heart rhythmsHeart surgery has risks; even though its results often are excellent. Risks include bleeding; infection; irregular heartbeats; and stroke. The risk is higher if you are older or a woman. The risk is also higher if you have other diseases or conditions; such as diabetes; kidney disease; lung disease; or peripheral arterial disease.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

Heart Transplantation,https://medlineplus.gov/hearttransplantation.html,A heart transplant removes a damaged or diseased heart and replaces it with a healthy one. The healthy heart comes from a donor who has died. It is the last resort for people with heart failure when all other treatments have failed. The heart failure might have been caused by coronary heart disease; damaged heart valves or heart muscles; congenital heart defects; or viral infections of the heart.Although heart transplant surgery is a life-saving measure; it has many risks. Careful monitoring; treatment; and regular medical care can prevent or help manage some of these risks.After the surgery; most heart transplant patients can return to their normal levels of activity. However; fewer than 30 percent return to work for many different reasons.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Heart Valve Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/heartvalvediseases.html,Your heart has four valves.

But many people have heart murmurs without having a problem. Heart tests can show if you have a heart valve disease. Some valve problems are minor and do not need treatment. Others might require medicine; medical procedures; or surgery to repair or replace the valve.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Heartburn,https://medlineplus.gov/heartburn.html,Heartburn is a painful burning feeling in your chest or throat. It happens when stomach acid backs up into your esophagus; the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach.If you have heartburn more than twice a week; you may have GERD. But you can have GERD without having heartburn.Pregnancy; certain foods; alcohol; and some medications can bring on heartburn. Treating heartburn is important because over time reflux can damage the esophagus.Over-the-counter medicines may help.  If the heartburn continues; you may need prescription medicines or surgery. If you have other symptoms such as crushing chest pain; it could be a heart attack. Get help immediately.
Heat Illness,https://medlineplus.gov/heatillness.html,Your body normally cools itself by sweating.  During hot weather; especially with high humidity; sweating just isn't enough.  Your body temperature can rise to dangerous levels and you can develop a heat illness.  Most heat illnesses occur from staying out in the heat too long. Exercising too much for your age and physical condition are also factors. Older adults; young children and those who are sick or overweight are most at risk. Drinking fluids to prevent dehydration; replenishing salt and minerals; and limiting time in the heat can help. Heat-related illnesses include  Heatstroke - a life-threatening illness in which body temperature may rise above 106 F in minutes; symptoms include dry skin; rapid; strong pulse and dizziness  Heat exhaustion -  an illness that can precede heatstroke; symptoms include heavy sweating; rapid breathing and a fast; weak pulse  Heat cramps - muscle pains or spasms that happen during heavy exercise   Heat rash - skin irritation from excessive sweating   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Heel Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/heelinjuriesanddisorders.html,Heel problems are common and can be painful. Often; they result from too much stress on your heel bone and the tissues that surround it. That stress can come fromInjuriesBruises that you get walking; running or jumping Wearing shoes that don't fit or aren't made wellBeing overweightThese can lead to tendinitis; bursitis; and fasciitis; which are all types of inflammation of the tissues that surround your heel. Over time the stress can cause bone spurs and deformities. Certain diseases; such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout; can also lead to heel problems. Treatments for heel problems might include rest; medicines; exercises; taping; and special shoes. Surgery is rarely needed.
Choking,https://medlineplus.gov/choking.html,Food or small objects can cause choking if they get caught in your throat and block your airway. This keeps oxygen from getting to your lungs and brain. If your brain goes without oxygen for more than four minutes; you could have brain damage or die.Young children are at an especially high risk of choking. They can choke on foods like hot dogs; nuts and grapes; and on small objects like toy pieces and coins. Keep hazards out of their reach and supervise them when they eat.When someone is choking; quick action can be lifesaving. Learn how to do back blows; the Heimlich maneuver (abdominal thrusts); and CPR.
Helicobacter Pylori Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/helicobacterpyloriinfections.html,Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a type of bacteria that causes infection in the stomach. It is found in about two-thirds of the world's population. It may be spread by unclean food and water; but researchers aren't sure. It causes Peptic ulcers and can also cause stomach cancer.If you have symptoms of a peptic ulcer; your doctor will test your blood; breath or stool to see if it contains H. pylori.  The best treatment is a combination of antibiotics and acid-reducing medicines. You will need to be tested after treatment to make sure the infection is gone.To help prevent an H. pylori infection; you shouldWash your hands after using the bathroom and before eatingEat properly prepared foodDrink water from a clean; safe sourceNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Benign Tumors,https://medlineplus.gov/benigntumors.html,Tumors are abnormal growths in your body. They can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. Benign tumors grow only in one place. They cannot spread or invade other parts of your body. Even so; they can be dangerous if they press on vital organs; such as your brain.Tumors are made up of extra cells. Normally; cells grow and divide to form new cells as your body needs them. When cells grow old; they die; and new cells take their place. Sometimes; this process goes wrong. New cells form when your body does not need them; and old cells do not die when they should. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form tumor.Treatment often involves surgery. Benign tumors usually don't grow back.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Birthmarks,https://medlineplus.gov/birthmarks.html,Birthmarks are abnormalities of the skin that are present when a baby is born. There are two types of birthmarks. Vascular birthmarks are made up of blood vessels that haven't formed correctly. They are usually red. Two types of vascular birthmarks are hemangiomas and port-wine stains.  Pigmented birthmarks are made of a cluster of pigment cells which cause color in skin. They can be many different colors; from tan to brown; gray to black; or even blue. Moles can be birthmarks.No one knows what causes many types of birthmarks; but some run in families. Your baby's doctor will look at the birthmark to see if it needs any treatment or if it should be watched. Pigmented birthmarks aren't usually treated; except for moles. Treatment for vascular birthmarks includes laser surgery. Most birthmarks are not serious; and some go away on their own. Some stay the same or get worse as you get older. Usually birthmarks are only a concern for your appearance. But certain types can increase your risk of skin cancer. If your birthmark bleeds; hurts; itches; or becomes infected; call your health care provider.
Vascular Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/vasculardiseases.html,The vascular system is the body's network of blood vessels. It includes the arteries; veins and capillaries that carry blood to and from the heart. Problems of the vascular system are common and can be serious. Arteries can become thick and stiff; a problem called atherosclerosis. Blood clots can clog vessels and block blood flow to the heart or brain. Weakened blood vessels can burst; causing bleeding inside the body. You are more likely to have vascular disease as you get older. Other factors that make vascular disease more likely include Family history of vascular or heart diseases Pregnancy Illness or injury  Long periods of sitting or standing still Any condition that affects the heart and blood vessels; such as diabetes or high cholesterol  Smoking  Obesity Losing weight; eating healthy foods; being active and not smoking can help vascular disease. Other treatments include medicines and surgery.
Blood Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/blooddisorders.html,Your blood is living tissue made up of liquid and solids. The liquid part; called plasma; is made of water; salts and protein. Over half of your blood is plasma. The solid part of your blood contains red blood cells; white blood cells and platelets.Blood disorders affect one or more parts of the blood and prevent your blood from doing its job.  They can be acute or chronic. Many blood disorders are inherited. Other causes include other diseases; side effects of medicines; and a lack of certain nutrients in your diet.Types of blood disorders includePlatelet disorders; excessive clotting; and bleeding problems; which affect how your blood clotsAnemia; which happens when your blood does not carry enough oxygen to the rest of your bodyCancers of the blood; such as leukemia and myelomaEosinophilic disorders; which are problems with one type of white blood cell.
Bleeding,https://medlineplus.gov/bleeding.html,Bleeding is the loss of blood. It can happen outside or inside the body. You may bleed when you get a cut or other wound. Bleeding can also be due to an injury to internal organs.Sometimes bleeding can cause other problems. A bruise is bleeding under the skin. Some strokes are caused by bleeding in the brain. Other bleeding; such as gastrointestinal bleeding; coughing up blood; or vaginal bleeding; can be a symptom of a disease.Normally; when you bleed; your blood forms clots to stop the bleeding.  Severe bleeding may require first aid or a trip to the emergency room. If you have a bleeding disorder; your blood does not form clots normally.
Urinalysis,https://medlineplus.gov/urinalysis.html,A urinalysis is a test of your urine. It is often done to check for a urinary tract infections; kidney problems; or diabetes. You may also have one during a checkup; if you are admitted to the hospital; before you have surgery; or if you are pregnant.  It can also monitor some medical conditions and treatments.A urinalysis involves checking the urine forIts colorIts appearance (whether it is clear or cloudy)Any odorThe pH level (acidity)Whether there are substances that are not normally in urine; such as blood; too much protein; glucose; ketones; and bilirubinWhether there are cells; crystals; and casts (tube-shaped proteins)Whether it contains bacteria or other germs
Paralysis,https://medlineplus.gov/paralysis.html,Paralysis is the loss of muscle function in part of your body. It happens when something goes wrong with the way messages pass between your brain and muscles. Paralysis can be complete or partial. It can occur on one or both sides of your body. It can also occur in just one area; or it can be widespread. Paralysis of the lower half of your body; including both legs; is called paraplegia. Paralysis of the arms and legs is quadriplegia.  Most paralysis is due to strokes or injuries such as spinal cord injury or a broken neck. Other causes of paralysis include  Nerve diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Autoimmune diseases such as Guillain-Barre syndrome  Bell's palsy; which affects muscles in the face  Polio used to be a cause of paralysis; but polio no longer occurs in the U.S.
Hemochromatosis,https://medlineplus.gov/hemochromatosis.html,Hemochromatosis is a disease in which too much iron builds up in your body. Your body needs iron but too much of it is toxic. If you have hemochromatosis; you absorb more iron than you need. Your body has no natural way to get rid of the extra iron. It stores it in body tissues; especially the liver; heart; and pancreas. The extra iron can damage your organs. Without treatment; it can cause your organs to fail.There are two types of hemochromatosis. Primary hemochromatosis is an inherited disease. Secondary hemochromatosis is usually the result of something else; such as anemia; thalassemia; liver disease; or blood transfusions.Many symptoms of hemochromatosis are similar to those of other diseases. Not everyone has symptoms. If you do; you may have joint pain; fatigue; general weakness; weight loss; and stomach pain.Your doctor will diagnose hemochromatosis based on your medical and family histories; a physical exam; and the results from tests and procedures. Treatments include removing blood (and iron) from your body; medicines; and changes in your diet.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Dialysis,https://medlineplus.gov/dialysis.html,When your kidneys are healthy; they clean your blood. They also make hormones that keep your bones strong and your blood healthy. When your kidneys fail; you need treatment to replace the work your kidneys used to do. Unless you have a kidney transplant; you will need a treatment called dialysis.There are two main types of dialysis. Both types filter your blood to rid your body of harmful wastes; extra salt; and water.Hemodialysis uses a machine. It is sometimes called an artificial kidney. You usually go to a special clinic for treatments several times a week.Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your abdomen; called the peritoneal membrane; to filter your blood.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
A1C,https://medlineplus.gov/a1c.html,A1C is a blood test for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. It measures your average blood glucose; or blood sugar; level over the past 3 months. Doctors may use the A1C alone or in combination with other diabetes tests to make a diagnosis. They also use the A1C to see how well you are managing your diabetes. This test is different from the blood sugar checks that people with diabetes do every day.Your A1C test result is given in percentages. The higher the percentage; the higher your blood sugar levels have been:A normal A1C level is below 5.7 percentPrediabetes is between 5.7 to 6.4 percent. Having prediabetes is a risk factor for getting type 2 diabetes. People with prediabetes may need retests every year.Type 2 diabetes is above 6.5 percentIf you have diabetes; you should have the A1C test at least twice a year. The A1C goal for many people with diabetes is below 7. It may be different for you. Ask what your goal should be. If your A1C result is too high; you may need to change your diabetes care plan.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Sickle Cell Anemia,https://medlineplus.gov/sicklecellanemia.html,Sickle cell anemia is a disease in which your body produces abnormally shaped red blood cells. The cells are shaped like a crescent or sickle. They don't last as long as normal; round red blood cells. This leads to anemia. The sickle cells also get stuck in blood vessels; blocking blood flow. This can cause pain and organ damage.A genetic problem causes sickle cell anemia. People with the disease are born with two sickle cell genes; one from each parent.  If you only have one sickle cell gene; it's called sickle cell trait. About 1 in 12 African Americans has sickle cell trait.The most common symptoms are pain and problems from anemia. Anemia can make you feel tired or weak. In addition; you might have shortness of breath; dizziness; headaches; or coldness in the hands and feet. A blood test can show if you have the trait or anemia.  Most states test newborn babies as part of their newborn screening programs.Sickle cell anemia has no widely available cure. Treatments can help relieve symptoms and lessen complications.  Researchers are investigating new treatments such as blood and marrow stem cell transplants; gene therapy; and new medicines.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Rh Incompatibility,https://medlineplus.gov/rhincompatibility.html,There are four major blood types: A; B; O; and AB. The types are based on substances on the surface of the blood cells. Another blood type is called Rh. Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells.  Most people are Rh-positive; they have Rh factor.  Rh-negative people don't have it.  Rh factor is inherited though genes.When you're pregnant; blood from your baby can cross into your bloodstream; especially during delivery. If you're Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive; your body will react to the baby's blood as a foreign substance.  It will create antibodies (proteins) against the baby's blood. These antibodies usually don't cause problems during a first pregnancy.But Rh incompatibility may cause problems in later pregnancies; if the baby is Rh-positive. This is because the antibodies stay in your body once they have formed.  The antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells.  The baby could get Rh disease; a serious condition that can cause a serious type of anemia.Blood tests can tell whether you have Rh factor and whether your body has made antibodies. Injections of a medicine called Rh immune globulin can keep your body from making Rh antibodies. It helps prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility.  If treatment is needed for the baby; it can include supplements to help the body to make red blood cells and blood transfusions.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Hemophilia,https://medlineplus.gov/hemophilia.html,Hemophilia is a rare disorder in which the blood does not clot normally.  It is usually inherited. Hemophilia usually occurs in males.If you have hemophilia; you have little or no clotting factor. Clotting factor is a protein needed for normal blood clotting. Without it; you may bleed for a long time after an injury or accident. You also may bleed into your knees; ankles; and elbows. Bleeding in the joints causes pain and; if not treated; can lead to arthritis. Bleeding in the brain; a very serious complication of hemophilia; requires emergency treatment.The main symptoms of hemophilia are excessive bleeding and easy bruising. Blood tests can tell if you have it.  The main treatment is injecting the missing clotting factor into the bloodstream. You may need it on a regular basis; or just when bleeding occurs.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Bleeding,https://medlineplus.gov/bleeding.html,Bleeding is the loss of blood. It can happen outside or inside the body. You may bleed when you get a cut or other wound. Bleeding can also be due to an injury to internal organs.Sometimes bleeding can cause other problems. A bruise is bleeding under the skin. Some strokes are caused by bleeding in the brain. Other bleeding; such as gastrointestinal bleeding; coughing up blood; or vaginal bleeding; can be a symptom of a disease.Normally; when you bleed; your blood forms clots to stop the bleeding.  Severe bleeding may require first aid or a trip to the emergency room. If you have a bleeding disorder; your blood does not form clots normally.
Hemorrhagic Fevers,https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhagicfevers.html,Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of illnesses caused by four families of viruses. These include the Ebola and Marburg; Lassa fever; and yellow fever viruses. VHFs have common features: they affect many organs; they damage the blood vessels; and they affect the body's ability to regulate itself. Some VHFs cause mild disease; but some; like Ebola or Marburg; cause severe disease and death.VHFs are found around the world. Specific diseases are usually limited to areas where the animals that carry them live. For example; Lassa fever is limited to rural areas of West Africa where rats and mice carry the virus.The risk for travelers is low; but you should avoid visiting areas where there are disease outbreaks. Because there are no effective treatments for some of these viral infections; there is concern about their use in bioterrorism.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Hemorrhagic Stroke,https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhagicstroke.html,A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic stroke is the less common type. It happens when a blood vessel breaks and bleeds into the brain. Within minutes; brain cells begin to die. Causes include a bleeding aneurysm; an arteriovenous malformation (AVM); or an artery wall that breaks open.Symptoms of stroke areSudden numbness or weakness of the face; arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)Sudden confusion; trouble speaking or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden trouble walking; dizziness; loss of balance or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeIt is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. With a hemorrhagic stroke; the first steps are to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and then control it.  Surgery may be needed.  Post-stroke rehabilitation can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Hemorrhoids,https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhoids.html,Hemorrhoids are swollen; inflamed veins around the anus or lower rectum. They are either inside the anus or under the skin around the anus. They often result from straining to have a bowel movement. Other factors include pregnancy; aging and chronic constipation or diarrhea.Hemorrhoids are very common in both men and women. About half of all people have hemorrhoids by age 50. The most common symptom of hemorrhoids inside the anus is bright red blood covering the stool; on toilet paper or in the toilet bowl. Symptoms usually go away within a few days.If you have rectal bleeding you should see a doctor. You need to make sure bleeding is not from a more serious condition such as colorectal or anal cancer. Treatment may include warm baths and a cream or other medicine.  If you have large hemorrhoids; you may need surgery and other treatments. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Liver Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html,Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons.There are many kinds of liver diseases:Diseases caused by  viruses; such as hepatitis A; hepatitis B; and hepatitis CDiseases caused by drugs; poisons; or too much alcohol. Examples include fatty liver disease and cirrhosis.Liver cancerInherited diseases; such as hemochromatosis and Wilson diseaseSymptoms of liver disease can vary; but they often include swelling of the abdomen and legs; bruising easily; changes in the color of your stool and urine; and jaundice; or yellowing of the skin and eyes. Sometimes there are no symptoms. Tests such as imaging tests and liver function tests can check for liver damage and help to diagnose liver diseases.
Liver Function Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/liverfunctiontests.html,Your liver helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons.  Liver function tests are blood tests that check to see how well your liver is working. They check for liver damage; and can help diagnose liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. You may have liver function tests as part of a regular checkup. Or you may have them if you have symptoms of liver disease. Doctors also use the tests to monitor some liver diseases; treatments; and possible side effects of medicines.Liver function tests measure certain proteins; enzymes; and substances; including:Albumin; a protein that the liver makesTotal protein (TP)Enzymes that are found in the liver; including alanine transaminase (ALT); aspartate transaminase (AST); alkaline phosphatase (ALP); and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)Bilirubin; a yellow substance that is part of bile. It is formed when your red blood cells break down. Too much bilirubin in the blood can cause jaundice. There is also a urine test for bilirubin.Prothrombin time; which measures how long it takes for your blood to clot. Prothrombin is made by the liver.
Liver Transplantation,https://medlineplus.gov/livertransplantation.html,Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons. You cannot live without a liver that works. If your liver fails; your doctor may put you on a waiting list for a liver transplant. Doctors do liver transplants when other treatment cannot keep a damaged liver working.During a liver transplantation; the surgeon removes the diseased liver and replaces it with a healthy one. Most transplant livers come from a donor who has died.  Sometimes there is a living donor.  This is when a healthy person donates part of his or her liver for a specific patient.The most common reason for a transplant in adults is cirrhosis. This is scarring of the liver; caused by injury or long-term disease. The most common reason in children is biliary atresia; a disease of the bile ducts.If you have a transplant; you must take drugs the rest of your life to help keep your body from rejecting the new liver.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Hepatitis,https://medlineplus.gov/hepatitis.html,Your liver is the largest organ inside your body.  It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Viruses cause most cases of hepatitis. The type of hepatitis is named for the virus that causes it; for example; hepatitis A; hepatitis  B or hepatitis C. Drug or alcohol use can also cause hepatitis. In other cases; your body mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the liver.Some people who have hepatitis have no symptoms. Others may haveLoss of appetiteNausea and vomitingDiarrheaDark-colored urine and pale bowel movementsStomach painJaundice; yellowing of skin and eyesSome forms of hepatitis are mild; and others can be serious. Some can lead to scarring; called cirrhosis; or to liver cancer.Sometimes hepatitis goes away by itself. If it does not; it can be treated with drugs. Sometimes hepatitis lasts a lifetime. Vaccines can help prevent some viral forms.
Hepatitis A,https://medlineplus.gov/hepatitisa.html,Your liver is the largest organ inside your body.  It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. One type; hepatitis A; is caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). The disease spreads through contact with an infected person's stool. You can get it fromEating food  made by an infected person who did not wash their hands after using the bathroomDrinking untreated water or eating food washed in untreated waterPutting into your mouth a finger or object that came into contact with an infected person's stoolHaving close contact with an infected person; such as through sex or caring for someone who is illMost people do not have any symptoms. If you do have symptoms; you may feel as if you have the flu. You may also have yellowish eyes and skin; called jaundice. A blood test will show if you have HAV.HAV usually gets better in a few weeks without treatment. However; some people can have symptoms for up to 6 months. Your doctor may suggest medicines to help relieve your symptoms.The hepatitis A vaccine can prevent HAV. Good hygiene can also help. Wash your hands thoroughly before preparing food; after using the toilet; or after changing a diaper. International travelers should be careful about drinking tap water.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Hepatitis B,https://medlineplus.gov/hepatitisb.html,Your liver is the largest organ inside your body.  It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. One type; hepatitis B; is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Hepatitis B spreads by contact with an infected person's blood; semen; or other body fluid.  An infected woman can give hepatitis B to her baby at birth.If you get HBV; you may feel as if you have the flu.  You may also have jaundice; a yellowing of skin and eyes; dark-colored urine; and pale bowel movements. Some people have no symptoms at all.  A blood test can tell if you have it.  HBV usually gets better on its own after a few months. If it does not get better; it is called chronic HBV; which lasts a lifetime. Chronic HBV can lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver); liver failure; or liver cancer.There is a vaccine for HBV.  It requires three shots.  All babies should get the vaccine; but older children and adults can get it too.  If you travel to countries where Hepatitis B is common; you should get the vaccine.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Hepatitis C,https://medlineplus.gov/hepatitisc.html,Your liver is the largest organ inside your body.  It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. One type; hepatitis C; is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It usually spreads through contact with infected blood.  It can also spread through sex with an infected person and from mother to baby during childbirth.Most people who are infected with hepatitis C don't have any symptoms for years. If you do get symptoms; you may feel as if you have the flu.  You may also have jaundice; a yellowing of skin and eyes; dark-colored urine; and pale bowel movements. A blood test can tell if you have it.  Usually; hepatitis C does not get better by itself. The infection can last a lifetime and may lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver cancer. Medicines sometimes help; but side effects can be a problem.  Serious cases may need a liver transplant.There is no vaccine for HCV.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Hepatitis Testing,https://medlineplus.gov/hepatitistesting.html,Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. There are different types of hepatitis. Some are caused by viruses. They include hepatitis A; hepatitis B; and hepatitis C. To diagnose hepatitis; your health care provider will ask you about your medical history and symptoms; do a physical exam; and order blood tests.There are blood tests for each type of viral hepatitis. Some tests check for antibodies to the virus. Antibodies are blood proteins that your immune system makes in response to the virus. Other blood tests look for parts of the virus; such as proteins or genetic material. Some tests show that you have the infection now. Other tests show that you have had it at some time; or that you have immunity to it.Doctors use the tests to diagnose hepatitis; and to screen people who are at risk for hepatitis B or C. The risk factors are different for each type. Doctors may also use the tests in people who have hepatitis; to check how contagious they are or to see how well treatment is working.
Liver Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/livercancer.html,Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons. Primary liver cancer starts in the liver.  Metastatic liver cancer starts somewhere else and spreads to your liver. Risk factors for primary liver cancer include Having hepatitis B or CHeavy alcohol useHaving cirrhosis; or scarring of the liverHaving hemochromatosis; an iron storage diseaseObesity and diabetesSymptoms can include a lump or pain on the right side of your abdomen and yellowing of the skin. However; you may not have symptoms until the cancer is advanced.  This makes it harder to treat. Doctors use tests that examine the liver and the blood to diagnose liver cancer. Treatment options include surgery; radiation; chemotherapy; or liver transplantation. NIH: National Cancer Institute

Wilson Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/wilsondisease.html,Wilson disease is a rare inherited disorder that prevents your body from getting rid of extra copper.  You need a small amount of copper from food to stay healthy. Too much copper is poisonous.Normally; your liver releases extra copper into bile; a digestive fluid.  With Wilson disease; the copper builds up in your liver; and it releases the copper directly into your bloodstream. This can cause damage to your brain; kidneys; and eyes.Wilson disease is present at birth; but symptoms usually start between ages 5 and 35. It first attacks the liver; the central nervous system or both. The most characteristic sign is a rusty brown ring around the cornea of the eye. A physical exam and laboratory tests can diagnose it.Treatment is with drugs to remove the extra copper from your body.  You need to take medicine and follow a low-copper diet for the rest of your life. Don't eat shellfish or liver; as these foods may contain high levels of copper.  At the beginning of treatment; you'll also need to avoid chocolate; mushrooms; and nuts. Have your drinking water checked for copper content and don't take multivitamins that contain copper.With early detection and proper treatment; you can enjoy good health.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Herbal Medicine,https://medlineplus.gov/herbalmedicine.html,An herb is a plant or plant part used for its scent; flavor; or therapeutic properties. Herbal medicines are one type of dietary supplement. They are sold as tablets; capsules; powders; teas; extracts; and fresh or dried plants. People use herbal medicines to try to maintain or improve their health.Many people believe that products labeled "natural" are always safe and good for them. This is not necessarily true. Herbal medicines do not have to go through the testing that drugs do. Some herbs; such as comfrey and ephedra; can cause serious harm. Some herbs can interact with prescription or over-the-counter medicines.If you are thinking about using an herbal medicine; first get information on it from reliable sources. Make sure to tell your health care provider about any herbal medicines you are taking.NIH: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health
Pesticides,https://medlineplus.gov/pesticides.html,Pests live where they are not wanted or cause harm to crops; people; or animals. Pesticides can help get rid of them. Pesticides are not just insect killers. They also include chemicals to control weeds; rodents; mildew; germs; and more. Many household products contain pesticides.Pesticides can protect your health by killing germs; animals; or plants that could hurt you.  However; they can also be harmful to people or pets. You might want to try non-chemical methods first. If you do need a pesticide; use it correctly. Be especially careful around children and pets. Proper disposal of pesticides is also important - it can help protect the environment.Biologically-based pesticides are becoming more popular. They often are safer than traditional pesticides.Environmental Protection Agency
Hernia,https://medlineplus.gov/hernia.html,A hernia happens when part of an internal organ or tissue bulges through a weak area of muscle. Most hernias are in the abdomen.There are several types of hernias; including Inguinal; in the groin. This is the the most common type. Umbilical; around the belly button Incisional; through a scar Hiatal; a small opening in the diaphragm that allows the upper part of the stomach to move up into the chest. Congenital diaphragmatic; a birth defect that needs surgeryHernias are common. They can affect men; women; and children.  A combination of muscle weakness and straining; such as with heavy lifting; might contribute. Some people are born with weak abdominal muscles and may be more likely to get a hernia.Treatment is usually surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. Untreated hernias can cause pain and health problems.
Herniated Disk,https://medlineplus.gov/herniateddisk.html,Your backbone; or spine; is made up of 26 bones called vertebrae. In between them are soft disks filled with a jelly-like substance. These disks cushion the vertebrae and keep them in place. As you age; the disks break down or degenerate. As they do; they lose their cushioning ability. This can lead to pain if the back is stressed.A herniated disk is a disk that ruptures. This allows the jelly-like center of the disk to leak; irritating the nearby nerves. This can cause sciatica or back pain.Your doctor will diagnose a herniated disk with a physical exam and; sometimes; imaging tests. With treatment; most people recover. Treatments include rest; pain and anti-inflammatory medicines; physical therapy; and sometimes surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Heroin,https://medlineplus.gov/heroin.html,Heroin is a white or brown powder or a black; sticky goo. It's  an opioid drug made from morphine; a natural substance in the seedpod of the Asian poppy plant. It can be mixed with water and injected with a needle. Heroin can also be smoked or snorted up the nose. All of these ways of taking heroin send it to the brain very quickly.  This makes it very addictive.Major health problems from heroin include miscarriages; heart infections; and death from overdose. People who inject the drug also risk getting infectious diseases; including HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.Regular use of heroin can lead to tolerance. This means users need more and more drug to have the same effect. At higher doses over time; the body becomes dependent on heroin. If dependent users stop heroin; they have withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms include restlessness; muscle and bone pain; diarrhea and vomiting; and cold flashes with goose bumps. NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Genital Herpes,https://medlineplus.gov/genitalherpes.html,Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by a herpes simplex virus (HSV). It can cause sores on your genital or rectal area; buttocks; and thighs.  You can get it from having vaginal; anal; or oral sex with someone who has it. The virus can spread even when sores are not present. Mothers can also infect their babies during childbirth.Symptoms of herpes are called outbreaks.  You usually get sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. The sores are blisters which break and become painful; and then heal. Sometimes people do not know they have herpes because they have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. The virus can be more serious in newborn babies or in people with weak immune systems.Repeat outbreaks are common; especially during the first year. Over time; you get them less often and the symptoms become milder.  The virus stays in your body for life.There are tests that can diagnose genital herpes. There is no cure.  However; medicines can help lessen symptoms; decrease outbreaks; and lower the risk of passing the virus to others. Correct usage of latex condoms can reduce; but not eliminate; the risk of catching or spreading herpes.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Herpes Simplex,https://medlineplus.gov/herpessimplex.html,Herpes is an infection that is caused by a herpes simplex virus (HSV). Oral herpes causes cold sores around the mouth or face.  Genital herpes affects the genitals; buttocks or anal area.  Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease (STD). It affects the genitals; buttocks or anal area. Other herpes infections can affect the eyes; skin; or other parts of the body. The virus can be dangerous in newborn babies or in people with weak immune systems. There are two types of HSV:HSV type 1 most commonly causes cold sores. It can also cause genital herpes.HSV type 2 is the usual cause of genital herpes; but it also can infect the mouth.HSV spreads through direct contact. Some people have no symptoms. Others get sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. They turn into blisters; become itchy and painful; and then heal.Most people have outbreaks several times a year. Over time; you get them less often. Medicines to help your body fight the virus can help lessen symptoms and decrease outbreaks.
Shingles,https://medlineplus.gov/shingles.html,Shingles is a disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus - the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have chickenpox; the virus stays in your body. It may not cause problems for many years.  As you get older; the virus may reappear as shingles. Although it is most common in people over age 50; anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk.You can't catch shingles from someone who has it.  However; if you have a shingles rash; you can pass the virus to someone who has never had chickenpox.  This would usually be a child; who could get chickenpox instead of shingles.  The virus spreads through direct contact with the rash; and cannot spread through the air.Early signs of shingles include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching; usually on one side of the body or face. The pain can be mild to severe. Rashes or blisters appear anywhere from one to 14 days later. If shingles appears on your face; it may affect your vision or hearing. The pain of shingles may last for weeks; months; or even years after the blisters have healed. There is no cure for shingles. Early treatment with medicines that fight the virus may help. These medicines may also help prevent lingering pain.A vaccine may prevent shingles or lessen its effects.  The vaccine is recommended for people 60 or over.  In some cases doctors may give it to people ages 50 to 59.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Cold Sores,https://medlineplus.gov/coldsores.html,Cold sores are caused by a contagious virus called herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two types of HSV. Type 1 usually causes oral herpes; or cold sores. Type 1 herpes virus infects more than half of the U.S. population by the time they reach their 20s. Type 2 usually affects the genital area.Some people have no symptoms from the infection. But others develop painful and unsightly cold sores. Cold sores usually occur outside the mouth; on or around the lips. When they are inside the mouth; they are usually on the gums or the roof of the mouth. They are not the same as canker sores; which are not contagious.There is no cure for cold sores. They normally go away on their own in a few weeks.  Antiviral medicines can help them heal faster.  They can also help to prevent cold sores in people who often get them. Other medicines can help with the pain and discomfort of the sores. These include ointments that numb the blisters; soften the crusts of the sores; or dry them out. Protecting your lips from the sun with sunblock lip balm can also help.
Hiatal Hernia,https://medlineplus.gov/hiatalhernia.html,A hiatal hernia is a condition in which the upper part of the stomach bulges through an opening in the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the muscle wall that separates the stomach from the chest. The diaphragm helps keep acid from coming up into the esophagus. When you have a hiatal hernia; it's easier for the acid to come up. The leaking of acid from the stomach into the esophagus is called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD may cause symptoms such as HeartburnProblems swallowingA dry coughBad breathHiatal hernias are common; especially in people over age 50. If you have symptoms; eating small meals; avoiding certain foods; not smoking or drinking alcohol; and losing weight may help. Your doctor may recommend antacids or other medicines. If these don't help; you may need surgery.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Haemophilus Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/haemophilusinfections.html,Haemophilus is the name of a group of bacteria. There are several types of Haemophilus. They can cause different types of illnesses involving breathing; bones and joints; and the nervous system.One common type; Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b); causes serious disease. It usually strikes children under 5 years old. Your child can get Hib disease by being around other children or adults who may have the bacteria and not know it. The germs spread from person to person. If the germs stay in the child's nose and throat; the child probably will not get sick. But sometimes the germs spread into the lungs or the bloodstream; and then Hib can cause serious problems such as meningitis and pneumonia.Treatment is with antibiotics. There is a vaccine to prevent Hib disease. All children younger than 5 years of age should be vaccinated with the Hib vaccine.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Hiccups,https://medlineplus.gov/hiccups.html,A hiccup is an unintentional movement of the diaphragm; the muscle at the base of the lungs. It's followed by quick closing of the vocal cords; which produces the "hic" sound you make. There are a large number of causes; including large meals; alcohol; or hot and spicy foods. Hiccups may also start and stop for no obvious reason.There is no sure way to stop hiccups. You can tryBreathing into a paper bagDrinking or sipping a glass of cold waterHolding your breathHiccups aren't usually serious. Contact your health care provider if they last for more than a few days.
Hidradenitis Suppurativa,https://medlineplus.gov/hidradenitissuppurativa.html,Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin disease. It can occur in one or multiple areas of your body. HS usually develops in your armpits; groin; and anal area. It causes long-term skin inflammation and can be painful. Symptoms include Blackheads and red; tender bumps; called abscesses. The abscesses get bigger; break open; and leak pusTunnels that form under the skin between abscessesScarringNo one knows what causes HS. It is more common in women; African Americans; and people who have had acne. It usually starts after the teenage years.  Treatments include antibiotics; anti-inflammatory medicines; and sometimes surgery. Losing weight or wearing looser clothing may help some patients avoid skin irritation.
Hyperglycemia,https://medlineplus.gov/hyperglycemia.html,Hyperglycemia means high blood sugar or glucose. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that  moves glucose into your cells to give them energy. Hyperglycemia happens when your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it the right way.People with diabetes can get hyperglycemia from not eating the right foods or not taking medicines correctly. Other problems that can raise blood sugar include infections; certain medicines; hormone imbalances; or severe illnesses.
High Blood Pressure,https://medlineplus.gov/highbloodpressure.html,Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats; it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats; pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest; between beats; your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. A reading of119/79 or lower is normal blood pressure140/90 or higher is high blood pressureBetween 120 and 139 for the top number; or between 80 and 89 for the bottom number is called prehypertension. Prehypertension means you may end up with high blood pressure; unless you take steps to prevent it.High blood pressure usually has no symptoms; but it can cause serious problems such as stroke; heart failure; heart attack and kidney failure.You can control high blood pressure through healthy lifestyle habits such as exercise and the DASH diet and taking medicines; if needed. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/highbloodpressureinpregnancy.html,If you are pregnant; high blood pressure can cause problems for you and your unborn baby. You may have had high blood pressure before you got pregnant. Or you may get it once you are pregnant - a condition called gestational hypertension. Either one can cause low birth weight or premature delivery of the baby.Controlling your blood pressure during pregnancy and getting regular prenatal care are important for the health of you and your baby. Treatments for high blood pressure in pregnancy may include close monitoring of the baby; lifestyle changes; and certain medicines.Some pregnant women with high blood pressure develop preeclampsia. It's a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It can be life-threatening for both you and the unborn baby. There is no proven way to prevent it. Most women who have signs of preeclampsia are closely monitored to lessen or avoid complications. The only way to "cure" preeclampsia is to deliver the baby.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Blood Pressure Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodpressuremedicines.html,High blood pressure; also called hypertension; usually has no symptoms. But it can cause serious problems such as stroke; heart failure; heart attack and kidney failure. If you cannot control your high blood pressure through lifestyle changes such as losing weight and reducing sodium in your diet; you may need medicines.Blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure. Some remove extra fluid and salt from the body. Others slow down the heartbeat or relax and widen blood vessels. Often; two or more medicines work better than one. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
How to Prevent High Blood Pressure,https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html,About 1 in 3 adults in the U.S. has high blood pressure; or hypertension; but many don't realize it. High blood pressure usually has no warning signs; yet it can lead to life-threatening conditions like heart attack or stroke. The good news is that you can often prevent or treat high blood pressure. Early diagnosis and simple; healthy changes can keep high blood pressure from seriously damaging your health.What is blood pressure?Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats; it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats; pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest; between beats; your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number.How do I know if my blood pressure is high?High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have high blood pressure is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge; a stethoscope or electronic sensor; and a blood pressure cuff. For most adults; blood pressure readings will be in one of four categories:Normal blood pressure meansYour systolic pressure is less than 120 ANDYour diastolic pressure is less than 80Prehypertension meansYour systolic pressure is between 120-139 ORYour diastolic pressure is between 80-89Stage 1 high blood pressure meansYour systolic pressure is between 140-159 ORYour diastolic pressure is between 90-99Stage 2 high blood pressure meansYour systolic pressure is 160 or higher ORYour diastolic pressure is 100 or higherFor children and teens; the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age; height; and gender.People with diabetes or chronic kidney disease should keep their blood pressure below 130/80.Why do I need to worry about prehypertension and high blood pressure?Prehypertension means you're likely to end up with high blood pressure; unless you take steps to prevent it.When your blood pressure stays high over time; it causes the heart to pump harder and work overtime; possibly leading to serious health problems such as heart attack; stroke; heart failure; and kidney failure.What are the different types of high blood pressure?There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure.Primary; or essential; high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. For most people who get this kind of blood pressure; it develops over time as you get older.Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. It usually gets better after you treat the cause or stop taking the medicines that are causing it.Who is at risk for high blood pressure?Anyone can develop high blood pressure; but there are certain factors that can increase your risk:Age - Blood pressure tends to rise with ageRace/Ethnicity - High blood pressure is more common in African American adultsWeight - People who are overweight or have obesity are more likely to develop prehypertension or high blood pressureGender - Before age 55; men are more likely than women to develop high blood pressure. After age 55; women are more likely than men to develop it.Lifestyle - Certain lifestyle habits can raise your risk for high blood pressure; such as eating too much sodium or not enough potassium; lack of exercise; drinking too much alcohol; and smoking.Family history - A family history of high blood pressure raises the risk of developing prehypertension or high blood pressureHow can I prevent high blood pressure?You can help prevent high blood pressure by having a healthy lifestyle. This meansEating a healthy diet. To help manage your blood pressure; you should limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat; and increase the amount of potassium in your diet. It is also important to eat foods that are lower in fat; as well as plenty of fruits; vegetables; and whole grains. The DASH diet is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure.Getting regular exercise. Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure. You should try to get moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 and a half hours per week; or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise; such as brisk walking; is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual.Being at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk for high blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems.Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories; which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks per day; and women only one.Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke; do not start. If you do smoke; talk to your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.Managing stress. Learning how to relax and manage stress can improve your emotional and physical health and lower high blood pressure. Stress management techniques include exercising; listening to music; focusing on something calm or peaceful; and meditating.If you already have high blood pressure; it is important to prevent it from getting worse or causing complications. You should get regular medical care and follow your prescribed treatment plan. Your plan will include healthy lifestyle habit recommendations and possibly medicines.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

Call your health care provider if something is bothering or worrying you.
Hip Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/hipinjuriesanddisorders.html,Your hip is the joint where your thigh bone meets your pelvis bone. Hips are called ball-and-socket joints because the ball-like top of your thigh bone moves within a cup-like space in your pelvis.  Your hips are very stable. When they are healthy; it takes great force to hurt them. However; playing sports; running; overuse or falling can all sometimes lead to hip injuries. These include    Strains  Bursitis  Dislocations  Fractures  Certain diseases also lead to hip injuries or problems. Osteoarthritis can cause pain and limited motion. Osteoporosis of the hip causes weak bones that break easily. Both of these are common in older people.  Treatment for hip disorders may include rest; medicines; physical therapy; or surgery; including hip replacement.
Hip Replacement,https://medlineplus.gov/hipreplacement.html,Hip replacement is surgery for people with severe hip damage. The most common cause of damage is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis causes pain; swelling; and reduced motion in your joints. It can interfere with your daily activities. If other treatments such as physical therapy; pain medicines; and exercise haven't helped; hip replacement surgery might be an option for you.During a hip replacement operation; the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from your hip joint and replaces them with new; man-made parts.A hip replacement canRelieve painHelp your hip joint work betterImprove walking and other movementsThe most common problem after surgery is hip dislocation. Because a man-made hip is smaller than the original joint; the ball can come out of its socket. The surgery can also cause blood clots and infections. With a hip replacement; you might need to avoid certain activities; such as jogging and high-impact sports.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Health Insurance,https://medlineplus.gov/healthinsurance.html,Health insurance helps protect you from high medical care costs. It is a contract between you and your insurance company. You buy a plan or policy; and the company agrees to pay part of your expenses when you need medical care.Many people in the United States get a health insurance policy through their employers. In most cases; the employer helps pay for that insurance. Insurance through employers is often with a managed care plan. These plans contract with health care providers and medical facilities to provide care for members at reduced costs. You can also purchase health insurance on your own.People who meet certain requirements can qualify for government health insurance; such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act expands health insurance coverage for many people in the U.S.
Personal Health Records,https://medlineplus.gov/personalhealthrecords.html,You've probably seen your chart at your doctor's office. In fact; you may have charts at several doctors' offices.  If you've been in the hospital; you have a chart there; too. These charts are your medical records. They may be on paper or electronic. To keep track of all this information; it's a good idea to keep your own personal health record.  What kind of information would you put in a personal health record? You could start withYour name; birth date; blood type; and emergency contact informationDate of last physicalDates and results of tests and screeningsMajor illnesses and surgeries; with datesA list of your medicines and supplements; the dosages; and how long you've taken themAny allergiesAny chronic diseasesAny history of illnesses in your family

Histoplasmosis,https://medlineplus.gov/histoplasmosis.html,Histoplasmosis is a disease caused by a fungus (or mold) called Histoplasma. The fungus is common in the eastern and central United States.   It grows in soil and material contaminated with bat or bird droppings. You get infected by breathing the fungal spores. You cannot get the infection from someone else. Histoplasmosis is often mild; with no symptoms.  If you do get sick; it usually affects your lungs.  Symptoms include feeling ill; fever; chest pains; and a dry cough.   In severe cases; histoplasmosis spreads to other organs. This is called disseminated disease. It is more common in infants; young children; seniors; and people with immune system problems.Your doctor might do a variety of tests to make the diagnosis; including a chest x-ray; CT scan of the lungs; or examining blood; urine; or tissues for signs of the fungus.  Mild cases usually get better without treatment. Treatment of severe or chronic cases is with antifungal drugs. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
HIV/AIDS,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaids.html,HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection. This puts you at risk for serious infections and certain cancers. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.HIV most often spreads through unprotected sex with an infected person. It may also spread by sharing drug needles or through contact with the blood of an infected person. Women can give it to their babies during pregnancy or childbirth. The first signs of HIV infection may be swollen glands and flu-like symptoms. These may come and go within two to four weeks. Severe symptoms may not appear until months or years later.A blood test can tell if you have HIV infection. Your health care provider can do the test; or you can use a home testing kit. Or to find free testing sites; call the national referral hotline at 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636 in English and en espaol; 1-888-232-6348 - TTY). There is no cure; but there are many medicines that fight HIV infection and lower the risk of infecting others. People who get early treatment can live with the disease for a long time.
HIV/AIDS and Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaidsandinfections.html,Having HIV/AIDS weakens your body's immune system. It destroys the white blood cells that fight infection. This puts you at risk for opportunistic infections (OIs). OIs are serious infections that take advantage of your weak immune system. These infections are less common and less severe in healthy people.There are many types of OIs:Bacterial infections; including tuberculosis and a serious related disease; Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)Viral infections; such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis CFungal infections; like yeast infections; cryptococcal meningitis; pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and histoplasmosisParasitic infections; such as crypto (cryptosporidiosis) and toxo (toxoplasmosis)Having HIV/AIDS can make infections harder to treat. People with HIV/AIDS are also more likely to have complications from common illnesses such as the flu.You can help prevent infections by taking your HIV/AIDS medicines. Other things that can help include practicing safe sex; washing your hands well and often; and cooking your food thoroughly.
HIV/AIDS and Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaidsandpregnancy.html,If you are pregnant and have HIV/AIDS;there is a risk of passing HIV to your baby. It can happen in three ways:During pregnancyDuring childbirth; especially if it is vaginal childbirth. In some cases; your doctor may suggest doing a Cesarean section to lower the risk during childbirth.During breastfeedingYou can greatly lower that risk by taking HIV/AIDS medicines. These medicines will also help protect your health. Since some medicines are not safe for babies; it is important to talk with your health care provider about which ones you should take. Then you need to make sure you take your medicines regularly.Your baby will get HIV/AIDS medicines for 4 to 6 weeks after birth. The medicines protect your baby from infection from any HIV that passed from you during childbirth. Your baby will get several tests to check for HIV over the first few months.Some pregnant women with HIV/AIDS may not know that they have it. So it is important that all women who are pregnant or planning to get pregnant have an HIV test as early as possible. Because most pregnant women with HIV/AIDS and their babies take HIV/AIDS medicines; few babies in the United States get HIV.
HIV/AIDS in Women,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaidsinwomen.html,HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection.  AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.HIV often spreads through unprotected sex with an infected person. Women can get it more easily during vaginal sex than men can. HIV may also spread by sharing drug needles or through contact with the blood of an infected person.About one in four people in the United States who have HIV are women. Women who have HIV/AIDS have some different problems from men; such asComplications such as repeated vaginal yeast infections; severe pelvic inflammatory disease (PID); and a higher risk of cervical cancerDifferent; sometimes more severe; side effects from the drugs that treat HIV/AIDSDrug interactions between some HIV/AIDS medicines and hormonal birth controlThe risk of giving HIV to their baby while pregnant or during childbirthWomen often don't get diagnosed until they are in the later in the stages of HIV infection. This means that they may be more at risk of infections.There is no cure; but there are many medicines to fight both HIV infection and the infections and cancers that come with it. People who get early treatment can live with the disease for a long time.
HIV/AIDS Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaidsmedicines.html,In the early 1980s; when the HIV/AIDS epidemic began; patients rarely lived longer than a few years. But today; there are many effective medicines to fight the infection; and people with HIV have longer; healthier lives.There are five major types of medicines:Reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors - interfere with a critical step during the HIV life cycle and keep the virus from making copies of itselfProtease inhibitors - interfere with a protein that HIV uses to make infectious viral particlesFusion inhibitors - block the virus from entering the body's cellsIntegrase inhibitors - block an enzyme HIV needs to make copies of itselfMultidrug combinations - combine two or more different types of drugs into oneThese medicines help people with HIV; but they are not perfect. They do not cure HIV/AIDS. People with HIV infection still have the virus in their bodies. They can still spread HIV to others through unprotected sex and needle sharing; even when they are taking their medicines.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Living with HIV/AIDS,https://medlineplus.gov/livingwithhivaids.html,HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.Infection with HIV is serious. But thanks to better treatments; people with HIV/AIDS are now living longer; and have a better quality of life. If you have HIV; you can help yourself byGetting medical care as soon as you find out that you have HIVFinding a health care provider has experience in treating HIV/AIDSIf are on any medicines; make sure to take them regularlyGetting support; such as from support groups; therapists; and social service organizationsLearning as much as you can about HIV/AIDS and its treatmentTrying to live a healthy lifestyle; including eating healthy foods; exercising regularly; and getting enough sleepIt is also important to reduce the risk of spreading HIV to other people. You should tell your sex partners that you have HIV; and always use condoms.
Hives,https://medlineplus.gov/hives.html,Hives are red and sometimes itchy bumps on your skin. An allergic reaction to a drug or food usually causes them.

Other causes include infections  and stress.Hives are very common.  They usually go away on their own; but if you have a serious case; you might need medicine or a shot. In rare cases; hives can cause a dangerous swelling in your airways; making it hard to breathe - which is a medical emergency.
Managed Care,https://medlineplus.gov/managedcare.html,Managed care plans are a type of health insurance. They have contracts with health care providers and medical facilities to provide care for members at reduced costs. These providers make up the plan's network. How much of your care the plan will pay for depends on the network's rules.Plans that restrict your choices usually cost you less. If you want a flexible plan; it will probably cost more. There are three types of managed care plans:Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) usually only pay for care within the network. You choose a primary care doctor who coordinates most of your care.Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO) usually pay more if you get care within the network. They still pay part of the cost if you go outside the network.Point of Service (POS) plans let you choose between an HMO or a PPO each time you need care.
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,https://medlineplus.gov/obsessivecompulsivedisorder.html,Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder. If you have OCD; you have frequent; upsetting thoughts called obsessions.  To try to control the thoughts; you feel an overwhelming urge to repeat certain rituals or behaviors. These are called compulsions.Examples of obsessions are a fear of germs or a fear of being hurt.  Compulsions include washing your hands; counting; checking on things; or cleaning. With OCD; the thoughts and rituals cause distress and get in the way of your daily life.Researchers think brain circuits may not work properly in people who have OCD. It tends to run in families. The symptoms often begin in children or teens. Treatments include therapy; medicines; or both. One type of therapy; cognitive behavioral therapy; is useful for treating OCD.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
Hodgkin Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/hodgkindisease.html,Hodgkin disease is a type of lymphoma. Lymphoma is a cancer of a part of the immune system called the lymph system.  The first sign of Hodgkin disease is often an enlarged lymph node. The disease can spread to nearby lymph nodes. Later it may spread to the lungs; liver; or bone marrow. The exact cause is unknown. Hodgkin disease is rare.  Symptoms includePainless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck; armpits; or groin Fever and chills Night sweats Weight loss Loss of appetite Itchy skinTo diagnose Hodgkin disease; doctors use a physical exam and history; blood tests; and a biopsy. Treatment depends on how far the disease has spread. It often includes radiation therapy or chemotherapy.The earlier the disease is diagnosed; the more effective the treatment. In most cases; Hodgkin disease can be cured. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Home Care Services,https://medlineplus.gov/homecareservices.html,Home care is care that allows a person with special needs stay in their home. It might be for people who are getting older; are chronically ill; recovering from surgery; or disabled.

Homeless Health Concerns,https://medlineplus.gov/homelesshealthconcerns.html,Poor health can contribute to being homeless; and being homeless can lead to poor health. Limited access to health care can make it worse. That's why the health of homeless people in the United States is worse than that of the general population. Common health problems includeMental health problemsSubstance abuse problemsBronchitis and pneumoniaProblems caused by being outdoorsWound and skin infectionsMany homeless women are victims of domestic or sexual abuse. Homeless children have high rates of emotional and behavioral problems; often from having witnessed abuse.Help such as shelters; health centers; and free meals are available. Contact your local homelessness assistance agency.
Complementary and Integrative Medicine,https://medlineplus.gov/complementaryandintegrativemedicine.html,Many Americans use medical treatments that are not part of mainstream medicine. When you are using these types of care; it may be called complementary; integrative; or alternative medicine.Complementary medicine is used together with mainstream medical care. An example is using acupuncture to help with side effects of cancer treatment. When health care providers and facilities offer both types of care; it is called integrative medicine. Alternative medicine is used instead of mainstream medical care.The claims that non-mainstream practitioners make can sound promising. However; researchers do not know how safe many of these treatments are or how well they work. Studies are underway to determine the safety and usefulness of many of these practices.To minimize the health risks of a non-mainstream treatmentDiscuss it with your doctor. It might have side effects or interact with other medicines.Find out what the research says about itChoose practitioners carefullyTell all of your doctors and practitioners about all of the different types of treatments you useNIH: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Health,https://medlineplus.gov/gaylesbianbisexualandtransgenderhealth.html,Gay; lesbian; bisexual; and transgender individuals have special health concerns besides the usual ones that affect most men and women.

Hormone Replacement Therapy,https://medlineplus.gov/hormonereplacementtherapy.html, Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her period stops.  It is a normal part of aging.  In the years before and during menopause; the levels of female hormones can go up and down.  This can cause symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Some women take hormone replacement therapy (HRT); also called menopausal hormone therapy; to relieve these symptoms.  HRT may also protect against osteoporosis.  However; HRT also has risks.  It can increase your risk of breast cancer; heart disease; and stroke. Certain types of HRT have a higher risk; and each woman's own risks can vary depending upon her health history and lifestyle. You and your health care provider need to discuss the risks and benefits for you. If you do decide to take HRT; it should be the lowest dose that helps and for the shortest time needed. Taking hormones should be re-evaluated every six months. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Hormones,https://medlineplus.gov/hormones.html,Hormones are your body's chemical messengers. They travel in your bloodstream to tissues or organs. They work slowly; over time; and affect many different processes; includingGrowth and developmentMetabolism - how your body gets energy from the foods you eat Sexual function Reproduction MoodEndocrine glands; which are special groups of cells; make hormones. The major endocrine glands are the pituitary; pineal; thymus; thyroid; adrenal glands; and pancreas. In addition; men produce hormones in their testes and women produce them in their ovaries. Hormones are powerful. It takes only a tiny amount to cause big changes in cells or even your whole body. That is why too much or too little of a certain hormone can be serious. Laboratory tests can measure the hormone levels in your blood; urine; or saliva.  Your health care provider may perform these tests if you have symptoms of a hormone disorder. Home pregnancy tests are similar - they test for pregnancy hormones in your urine.
Autonomic Nervous System Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/autonomicnervoussystemdisorders.html,Your autonomic nervous system is the part of your nervous system that controls involuntary actions; such as the beating of your heart and the widening or narrowing of your blood vessels. When something goes wrong in this system; it can cause serious problems; including  Blood pressure problems Heart problems Trouble with breathing and swallowing Erectile dysfunction in men  Autonomic nervous system disorders can occur alone or as the result of another disease; such as Parkinson's disease; alcoholism and diabetes. Problems can affect either part of the system; as in complex regional pain syndromes; or all of the system. Some types are temporary; but many worsen over time. When they affect your breathing or heart function; these disorders can be life-threatening. Some autonomic nervous system disorders get better when an underlying disease is treated. Often; however; there is no cure. In that case; the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms.  NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Hospice Care,https://medlineplus.gov/hospicecare.html,Hospice care is end-of-life care. A team of health care professionals and volunteers provides it. They give medical; psychological; and spiritual support. The goal of the care is to help people who are dying have peace; comfort; and dignity. The caregivers try to control pain and other symptoms so a person can remain as alert and comfortable as possible. Hospice programs also provide services to support a patient's family. Usually; a hospice patient is expected to live 6 months or less. Hospice care can take placeAt homeAt a hospice centerIn a hospitalIn a skilled nursing facilityNIH: National Cancer Institute
Health Facilities,https://medlineplus.gov/healthfacilities.html,Health facilities are places that provide health care. They include hospitals; clinics; outpatient care centers; and specialized care centers; such as birthing centers and psychiatric care centers.When you choose a health facility; you might want to considerHow close it is to where you live or workWhether your health insurance will pay for services thereWhether your health care provider can treat you thereThe quality of the facilityQuality is important.  Some facilities do a better job than others. One way to learn about the quality of a facility is to look at report cards developed by federal; state; and consumer groups.
Fever,https://medlineplus.gov/fever.html,A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal. A normal temperature can vary from person to person; but it is usually around 98.6 F. A fever is not a disease. It is usually a sign that your body is trying to fight an illness or infection.Infections cause most fevers. You get a fever because your body is trying to kill the virus or bacteria that caused the infection. Most of those bacteria and viruses do well when your body is at your normal temperature. But if you have a fever; it is harder for them to survive. Fever also activates your body's immune system.Other causes of fevers includeMedicines; including some antibiotics; blood pressure medicines; and anti-seizure medicinesHeat illnessCancersAutoimmune diseasesSome childhood immunizationsTreatment depends on the cause of your fever. If the fever is very high; your health care provider may recommend taking an over-the-counter medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Adults can also take aspirin; but children with fevers should not take aspirin. It is also important to drink enough liquids; to prevent dehydration.
Heat Illness,https://medlineplus.gov/heatillness.html,Your body normally cools itself by sweating.  During hot weather; especially with high humidity; sweating just isn't enough.  Your body temperature can rise to dangerous levels and you can develop a heat illness.  Most heat illnesses occur from staying out in the heat too long. Exercising too much for your age and physical condition are also factors. Older adults; young children and those who are sick or overweight are most at risk. Drinking fluids to prevent dehydration; replenishing salt and minerals; and limiting time in the heat can help. Heat-related illnesses include  Heatstroke - a life-threatening illness in which body temperature may rise above 106 F in minutes; symptoms include dry skin; rapid; strong pulse and dizziness  Heat exhaustion -  an illness that can precede heatstroke; symptoms include heavy sweating; rapid breathing and a fast; weak pulse  Heat cramps - muscle pains or spasms that happen during heavy exercise   Heat rash - skin irritation from excessive sweating   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Menopause,https://medlineplus.gov/menopause.html,Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her period stops.  It usually occurs naturally; most often after age 45. Menopause happens because the woman's ovaries stop producing the hormones estrogen and progesterone. A woman has reached menopause when she has not had a period for one year.  Changes and symptoms can start several years earlier. They includeA change in periods - shorter or longer; lighter or heavier; with more or less time in between Hot flashes and/or night sweats Trouble sleeping Vaginal dryness Mood swingsTrouble focusingLess hair on head; more on face Some symptoms require treatment.  Talk to your doctor about how to best manage menopause.  Make sure the doctor knows your medical history and your family medical history. This includes whether you are at risk for heart disease; osteoporosis; or breast cancer.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health

How Much Exercise Do I Need?,https://medlineplus.gov/howmuchexercisedoineed.html,Regular exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health. It has many benefits; including improving your overall health and fitness; and reducing your risk for many chronic diseases. To get the most benefit; the recommendations for how much exercise you need are:For adults:Try to get at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity on most days.Aerobic activities include walking fast; jogging; swimming; and bikingExercise at a moderate intensity. One way to check this is to make sure that you can say a few words in a row while exercising. But you should not be able to sing - that would mean that you are not exercising hard enough.You can break your aerobic exercise into segments of ten minutes or moreAlso; do strengthening activities twice per week.Strengthening activities include lifting weights; working with exercise bands; and doing sit-ups and pushupsChoose activities that work all the different parts of the body - your legs; hips; back; chest; stomach; shoulders; and arms. You should repeat exercises for each muscle group 8 to 12 times per session.For children and teens:Get 60 minutes or more of physical activity every day. Most of it should be moderate-intensity aerobic activity.Activities should vary and be a good fit for the child's age and physical developmentModerate-intensity aerobic activities include walking; running; skipping; playing on the playground; playing basketball; and bikingAlso; try to get each of these at least 3 days a week: vigorous-intensity aerobic activity; muscle-strengthening activity; and bone-strengthening activity.Vigorous-intensity aerobic activities include running; doing jumping jacks; and fast swimmingMuscle-strengthening exercise includes playing on playground equipment; playing tug-of-war; and doing pushups and pull-upsBone-strengthening activities include hopping; skipping; doing jumping jacks; playing volleyball; and working with resistance bandsOther groups:Seniors; pregnant women; and people who have special health needs should check with their health care provider on how much exercise they should get and what types of exercises they should do.People who are trying to lose weight may need to get more exercise. They also need to adjust their diet; so they are burning more calories than they eat and drink.If you have been inactive; you may need to start slowly. You can keep adding more gradually. The more you can do; the better. But try not to feel overwhelmed; and do what you can. Getting some exercise is always better than getting none.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
How to Prevent Diabetes,https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html,What is type 2 diabetes?If you have diabetes; your blood sugar levels are too high. With type 2 diabetes; this happens because your body does not make enough insulin; or it does not use insulin well (this is called insulin resistance). If you are at risk for type 2 diabetes; you might be able to prevent or delay developing it.Who is at risk for type 2 diabetes?Many Americans are at risk for type 2 diabetes. Your chances of getting it depend on a combination of risk factors such as your genes and lifestyle. The risk factors includeHaving prediabetes; which means you have blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetesBeing overweight or having obesityBeing age 45 or olderA family history of diabetesBeing African American; Alaska Native; American Indian; Asian American; Hispanic/Latino; Native Hawaiian; or Pacific IslanderHaving high blood pressureHaving a low level of HDL (good) cholesterol or a high level of triglyceridesA history of diabetes in pregnancyHaving given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or moreAn inactive lifestyleA history of heart disease or strokeHaving depressionHaving polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)Having acanthosis nigricans; a skin condition in which your skin becomes dark and thick; especially around your neck or armpitsSmokingHow can I prevent or delay getting type 2 diabetes?If you are at risk for diabetes; you may be able to prevent or delay getting it. Most of the things that you need to do involve having a healthier lifestyle. So if you make these changes; you will get other health benefits as well. You may lower your risk of other diseases; and you will probably feel better and have more energy. The changes areLosing weight and keeping it off. Weight control is an important part of diabetes prevention. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes by losing 5 to 10 percent of your current weight. For example; if you weigh 200 pounds; your goal would be to lose between 10 to 20 pounds. And once you lose the weight; it is important that you don't gain it back.Following a healthy eating plan. It is important to reduce the amount of calories you eat and drink each day; so you can lose weight and keep it off. To do that; your diet should include smaller portions and less fat and sugar. You should also eat a variety of foods from each food group; including plenty of whole grains; fruits; and vegetables. It's also a good idea to limit red meat; and avoid processed meats.Get regular exercise. Exercise has many health benefits; including helping you to lose weight and lower your blood sugar levels. These both lower your risk of type 2 diabetes. Try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity 5 days a week. If you have not been active; talk with your health care professional to figure out which types of exercise are best for you. You can start slowly and work up to your goal.Don't smoke. Smoking can contribute to insulin resistance; which can lead to type 2 diabetes. If you already smoke; try to quit.Talk to your health care provider to see whether there is anything else you can do to delay or to prevent type 2 diabetes. If you are at high risk; your provider may suggest that you take one of a few types of diabetes medicines.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
How to Prevent Heart Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventheartdisease.html,Heart disease is the leading cause of the death in the United States. It is also a major cause of disability. There are many things that can raise your risk for heart disease. They are called risk factors. Some of them you cannot control; but there are many that you can control. Learning about them can lower your risk of heart disease.What are the heart disease risk factors that I cannot change?Age. Your risk of heart disease increases as you get older. Men age 45 and older and women age 55 and older have a greater risk.Gender. Some risk factors may affect heart disease risk differently in women than in men. For example; estrogen provides women some protection against heart disease; but diabetes raises the risk of heart disease more in women than in men.Race or ethnicity. Certain groups have higher risks than others. African Americans are more likely than whites to have heart disease; while Hispanic Americans are less likely to have it. Some Asian groups; such as East Asians; have lower rates; but South Asians have higher rates.Family history. You have a greater risk if you have a close family member who had heart disease at an early age.What can I do to lower my risk of heart disease?Fortunately; there are many things you can do to reduce your chances of getting heart disease:Control your blood pressure. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease. It is important to get your blood pressure checked regularly - at least once a year for most adults; and more often if you have high blood pressure. Take steps; including lifestyle changes; to prevent or control high blood pressure.Keep your cholesterol and triglyceride levels under control. High levels of cholesterol can clog your arteries and raise your risk of coronary artery disease and heart attack. Triglycerides are another type of fat in the blood. High  levels of triglycerides may also raise the risk of coronary artery disease; especially in women.Stay at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity can increase your risk for heart disease. This is mostly because they are linked to other heart disease risk factors; including high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels; high blood pressure; and diabetes. Controlling your weight can lower these risks.Eat a healthy diet. Try to limit saturated fats; foods high in sodium; and added sugars. Eat plenty of fresh fruit; vegetables; and whole grains. The DASH diet is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol; two things that can lower your risk of heart disease.Get regular exercise. Exercise has many benefits; including strengthening your heart and improving your circulation. It can also help you maintain a healthy weight and lower cholesterol and blood pressure. All of these can lower your risk of heart disease.Limit alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories; which may cause weight gain. Both of those raise your risk of heart disease. Men should have no more than two alcoholic drinks per day; and women should not have more than one.Don't smoke. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke; do not start. If you do smoke; quitting will lower your risk for heart disease. You can talk with your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.Manage stress. Stress is linked to heart disease in many ways. It can raise your blood pressure. Extreme stress can be a "trigger" for a heart attack. Also; some common ways of coping with stress; such as overeating; heavy drinking; and smoking; are bad for your heart. Some ways to help manage your stress include exercise; listening to music; focusing on something calm or peaceful; and meditating.Manage diabetes. Having diabetes doubles your risk of diabetic heart disease. That is because over time; high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. So; it is important to get tested for diabetes; and if you have it; to keep it under control.Make sure that you get enough sleep. If you don't get enough sleep; you raise your risk of high blood pressure; obesity; and diabetes. Those three things can raise your risk for heart disease. Most adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. Make sure that you have good sleep habits. If you have frequent sleep problems; contact your health care provider. One problem; sleep apnea; causes people to briefly stop breathing many times during sleep. This interferes with your ability to get a good rest and can raise your risk of heart disease. If you think you might have it; ask your doctor about having a sleep study. And if you do have sleep apnea; make sure that you get treatment for it.
How to Prevent High Blood Pressure,https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html,About 1 in 3 adults in the U.S. has high blood pressure; or hypertension; but many don't realize it. High blood pressure usually has no warning signs; yet it can lead to life-threatening conditions like heart attack or stroke. The good news is that you can often prevent or treat high blood pressure. Early diagnosis and simple; healthy changes can keep high blood pressure from seriously damaging your health.What is blood pressure?Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats; it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats; pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest; between beats; your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number.How do I know if my blood pressure is high?High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have high blood pressure is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge; a stethoscope or electronic sensor; and a blood pressure cuff. For most adults; blood pressure readings will be in one of four categories:Normal blood pressure meansYour systolic pressure is less than 120 ANDYour diastolic pressure is less than 80Prehypertension meansYour systolic pressure is between 120-139 ORYour diastolic pressure is between 80-89Stage 1 high blood pressure meansYour systolic pressure is between 140-159 ORYour diastolic pressure is between 90-99Stage 2 high blood pressure meansYour systolic pressure is 160 or higher ORYour diastolic pressure is 100 or higherFor children and teens; the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age; height; and gender.People with diabetes or chronic kidney disease should keep their blood pressure below 130/80.Why do I need to worry about prehypertension and high blood pressure?Prehypertension means you're likely to end up with high blood pressure; unless you take steps to prevent it.When your blood pressure stays high over time; it causes the heart to pump harder and work overtime; possibly leading to serious health problems such as heart attack; stroke; heart failure; and kidney failure.What are the different types of high blood pressure?There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure.Primary; or essential; high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. For most people who get this kind of blood pressure; it develops over time as you get older.Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. It usually gets better after you treat the cause or stop taking the medicines that are causing it.Who is at risk for high blood pressure?Anyone can develop high blood pressure; but there are certain factors that can increase your risk:Age - Blood pressure tends to rise with ageRace/Ethnicity - High blood pressure is more common in African American adultsWeight - People who are overweight or have obesity are more likely to develop prehypertension or high blood pressureGender - Before age 55; men are more likely than women to develop high blood pressure. After age 55; women are more likely than men to develop it.Lifestyle - Certain lifestyle habits can raise your risk for high blood pressure; such as eating too much sodium or not enough potassium; lack of exercise; drinking too much alcohol; and smoking.Family history - A family history of high blood pressure raises the risk of developing prehypertension or high blood pressureHow can I prevent high blood pressure?You can help prevent high blood pressure by having a healthy lifestyle. This meansEating a healthy diet. To help manage your blood pressure; you should limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat; and increase the amount of potassium in your diet. It is also important to eat foods that are lower in fat; as well as plenty of fruits; vegetables; and whole grains. The DASH diet is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure.Getting regular exercise. Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure. You should try to get moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 and a half hours per week; or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise; such as brisk walking; is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual.Being at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk for high blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems.Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories; which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks per day; and women only one.Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke; do not start. If you do smoke; talk to your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.Managing stress. Learning how to relax and manage stress can improve your emotional and physical health and lower high blood pressure. Stress management techniques include exercising; listening to music; focusing on something calm or peaceful; and meditating.If you already have high blood pressure; it is important to prevent it from getting worse or causing complications. You should get regular medical care and follow your prescribed treatment plan. Your plan will include healthy lifestyle habit recommendations and possibly medicines.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
HPV,https://medlineplus.gov/hpv.html,Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a group of related viruses. They can cause warts on different parts of your body. There are more than 200 types. About 40 of those types affect the genitals. They are spread through sexual contact with an infected partner. Some of those can put you at risk for cancer.There are two categories of sexually-transmitted HPV. Low-risk HPV can cause genital warts. High-risk HPV can cause various cancers:Cervical cancerAnal cancerSome types of oral and throat cancerVulvar cancerVaginal cancerPenile cancerHPV infections are the most common sexually transmitted infections in the United States. Anyone who has ever been sexually active can get HPV; but you are more likely to get it if you have had many sex partners or have had sex with someone who has had many partners. Because it is so common; most people get HPV infections shortly after becoming sexually active for the first time.Some people develop genital warts from HPV infection; but others have no symptoms. Most high-risk HPV infections go away within 1 to 2 years and do not cause cancer. Some HPV infections; however; can persist for many years. Those infections can lead to cell changes that; if not treated; may become cancerous.In women; Pap tests can detect changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer. Pap tests; along with HPV tests; are used in cervical cancer screening.Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces; but does not completely eliminate; the risk of catching or spreading HPV. Vaccines can protect against several types of HPV; including some that can cause cancer.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

Hormone Replacement Therapy,https://medlineplus.gov/hormonereplacementtherapy.html, Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her period stops.  It is a normal part of aging.  In the years before and during menopause; the levels of female hormones can go up and down.  This can cause symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Some women take hormone replacement therapy (HRT); also called menopausal hormone therapy; to relieve these symptoms.  HRT may also protect against osteoporosis.  However; HRT also has risks.  It can increase your risk of breast cancer; heart disease; and stroke. Certain types of HRT have a higher risk; and each woman's own risks can vary depending upon her health history and lifestyle. You and your health care provider need to discuss the risks and benefits for you. If you do decide to take HRT; it should be the lowest dose that helps and for the shortest time needed. Taking hormones should be re-evaluated every six months. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Inhalants,https://medlineplus.gov/inhalants.html,If you're a parent; you may fear that your kids will use drugs such as marijuana or LSD. But you may not realize the dangers of substances in your own home. Household products such as glues; hair sprays; paints and lighter fluid can be drugs for kids in search of a quick high. Many young people inhale vapors from these; not knowing that it can cause serious health problems.Both parents and kids need to know the dangers. Even inhaling once can disrupt heart rhythms and lower oxygen levels. Either of these can cause death. Regular abuse can result in serious harm to the brain; heart; kidneys; and liver.

Genes and Gene Therapy,https://medlineplus.gov/genesandgenetherapy.html,Genes are the building blocks of inheritance. Passed from parent to child; they contain instructions for making proteins. If genes don't produce the right proteins or don't produce them correctly; a child can have a genetic disorder.  Gene therapy is an experimental technique that uses genes to treat or prevent disease. The most common form of gene therapy involves inserting a normal gene to replace an abnormal gene. Other approaches include  Swapping an abnormal gene for a normal one Repairing an abnormal gene Altering the degree to which a gene is turned on or off  Although there is much hope for gene therapy; it is still experimental.

HIV/AIDS,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaids.html,HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection. This puts you at risk for serious infections and certain cancers. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.HIV most often spreads through unprotected sex with an infected person. It may also spread by sharing drug needles or through contact with the blood of an infected person. Women can give it to their babies during pregnancy or childbirth. The first signs of HIV infection may be swollen glands and flu-like symptoms. These may come and go within two to four weeks. Severe symptoms may not appear until months or years later.A blood test can tell if you have HIV infection. Your health care provider can do the test; or you can use a home testing kit. Or to find free testing sites; call the national referral hotline at 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636 in English and en espaol; 1-888-232-6348 - TTY). There is no cure; but there are many medicines that fight HIV infection and lower the risk of infecting others. People who get early treatment can live with the disease for a long time.

Huntington's Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/huntingtonsdisease.html,Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited disease that causes certain nerve cells in the brain to waste away. People are born with the defective gene; but symptoms usually don't appear until middle age. Early symptoms of HD may include uncontrolled movements; clumsiness; and balance problems. Later; HD can take away the ability to walk; talk; and swallow. Some people stop recognizing family members. Others are aware of their environment and are able to express emotions.If one of your parents has Huntington's disease; you have a 50 percent chance of getting it. A blood test can tell you if have the HD gene and will develop the disease. Genetic counseling can help you weigh the risks and benefits of taking the test.There is no cure.  Medicines can help manage some of the symptoms; but cannot slow down or stop the disease.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Hurricanes,https://medlineplus.gov/hurricanes.html,A hurricane is a severe type of tropical storm. Hurricanes produce high winds; heavy rains and thunderstorms.   Hurricanes can cause tremendous damage. Winds can exceed 155 miles per hour. Hurricanes and tropical storms can also spawn tornadoes and lead to flooding. The high winds and heavy rains can destroy buildings; roads and bridges; and knock down power lines and trees. In coastal areas; very high tides called storm surges cause extensive damage.Although there are no guarantees of safety during a hurricane; you can take actions to protect yourself.  You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear; anxiety; and losses. If you do experience a disaster; it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.Federal Emergency Management Agency
Hydrocephalus,https://medlineplus.gov/hydrocephalus.html,Hydrocephalus is the buildup of too much cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Normally; this fluid cushions your brain. When you have too much; though; it puts harmful pressure on your brain.Hydrocephalus can be congenital; or present at birth. Causes include genetic problems and problems with how the fetus develops. An unusually large head is the main sign of congenital hydrocephalus.Hydrocephalus can also happen after birth. This is called acquired hydrocephalus. It can occur at any age. Causes can include head injuries; strokes; infections; tumors; and bleeding in the brain. Symptoms includeHeadacheVomiting and nauseaBlurry visionBalance problemsBladder control problemsThinking and memory problemsHydrocephalus can permanently damage the brain; causing problems with physical and mental development. If untreated; it is usually fatal. With treatment; many people lead normal lives with few limitations. Treatment usually involves surgery to insert a shunt. A shunt is a flexible but sturdy plastic tube. The shunt moves the cerebrospinal fluid to another area of the body where it can be absorbed. Medicine and rehabilitation therapy can also help.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Rabies,https://medlineplus.gov/rabies.html,Rabies is a deadly animal disease caused by a virus. It can happen in wild animals; including raccoons; skunks; bats and foxes; or in dogs; cats or farm animals. People get it from the bite of an infected animal.

Nearly everyone shows some of these behaviors at times; but ADHD lasts more than 6 months and causes problems in school; at home and in social situations.ADHD is more common in boys than girls. It affects 3-5 percent of all American children.The main features of ADHD areInattentionHyperactivityImpulsivityNo one knows exactly what causes ADHD. It sometimes runs in families; so genetics may be a factor. There may also be environmental factors.A complete evaluation by a trained professional is the only way to know for sure if your child has ADHD.  Treatment may include medicine to control symptoms; therapy; or both. Structure at home and at school is important. Parent training may also help.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
Oxygen Therapy,https://medlineplus.gov/oxygentherapy.html,Oxygen therapy is a treatment that provides you with extra oxygen. Oxygen is a gas that your body needs to function. Normally; your lungs absorb oxygen from the air you breathe. But some conditions can prevent you from getting enough oxygen.You may need oxygen if you haveCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)PneumoniaA severe asthma attackLate-stage heart failureCystic fibrosisSleep apneaThe oxygen comes through nasal prongs; a mask; or a breathing tube.

Your body needs calcium to help muscles and blood vessels contract and expand; to secrete hormones and enzymes and to send messages through the nervous system. It is important to get plenty of calcium in the foods you eat. Foods rich in calcium includeDairy products such as milk; cheese; and yogurtLeafy; green vegetablesFish with soft bones that you eat; such as canned sardines and salmonCalcium-enriched foods such as breakfast cereals; fruit juices; soy and rice drinks; and tofu. Check the product labels.The exact amount of calcium you need depends on your age and other factors. Growing children and teenagers need more calcium than young adults. Older women need plenty of calcium to prevent osteoporosis. People who do not eat enough high-calcium foods should take a calcium supplement.NIH: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements
Cholesterol,https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterol.html,Cholesterol is a waxy; fat-like substance that occurs naturally in all parts of the body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much in your blood; it can combine with other substances in the blood and stick to the walls of your arteries. This is called plaque. Plaque can narrow your arteries or even block them.High levels of cholesterol in the blood can increase your risk of heart disease. Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older. There are usually no signs or symptoms that you have high blood cholesterol; but it can be detected with a blood test.

Refractive Errors,https://medlineplus.gov/refractiveerrors.html,The cornea and lens of your eye helps you focus.  Refractive errors are vision problems that happen when the shape of the eye keeps you from focusing well. The cause could be the length of the eyeball (longer or shorter); changes in the shape of the cornea; or aging of the lens.Four common refractive errors areMyopia; or nearsightedness - clear vision close up but  blurry in the distanceHyperopia; or farsightedness - clear vision in the distance but blurry close upPresbyopia - inability to focus close up as a result of agingAstigmatism - focus problems caused by the corneaThe most common symptom is blurred vision. Other symptoms may include double vision; haziness; glare or halos around bright lights; squinting; headaches; or eye strain.Glasses or contact lenses can usually correct refractive errors. Laser eye surgery may also be a possibility.NIH: National Eye Institute
Parathyroid Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/parathyroiddisorders.html,Most people have four pea-sized glands; called parathyroid glands; on the thyroid gland in the neck. Though their names are similar; the thyroid and parathyroid glands are completely different. The parathyroid glands make parathyroid hormone (PTH); which helps your body keep the right balance of calcium and phosphorous.If your parathyroid glands make too much or too little hormone; it disrupts this balance. If they secrete extra PTH; you have hyperparathyroidism; and your blood calcium rises. In many cases; a benign tumor on a parathyroid gland makes it overactive. Or; the extra hormones can come from enlarged parathyroid glands. Very rarely; the cause is cancer.If you do not have enough PTH; you have hypoparathyroidism. Your blood will have too little calcium and too much phosphorous. Causes include injury to the glands; endocrine disorders; or genetic conditions. Treatment is aimed at restoring the balance of calcium and phosphorous.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Skin Pigmentation Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/skinpigmentationdisorders.html,Pigmentation means coloring. Skin pigmentation disorders affect the color of your skin. Your skin gets its color from a pigment called melanin. Special cells in the skin make melanin. When these cells become damaged or unhealthy; it affects melanin production. Some pigmentation disorders affect just patches of skin. Others affect your entire body. If your body makes too much melanin; your skin gets darker. Pregnancy; Addison's disease; and sun exposure all can make your skin darker. If your body makes too little melanin; your skin gets lighter. Vitiligo is a condition that causes patches of light skin. Albinism is a genetic condition affecting a person's skin. A person with albinism may have no color; lighter than normal skin color; or patchy missing skin color. Infections; blisters and burns can also cause lighter skin.
Allergy,https://medlineplus.gov/allergy.html,An allergy is a reaction by your immune system to something that does not bother most other people. People who have allergies often are sensitive to more than one thing. Substances that often cause reactions arePollenDust mitesMold sporesPet danderFoodInsect stingsMedicinesNormally; your immune system fights germs. It is your body's defense system. In most allergic reactions; however; it is responding to a false alarm. Genes and the environment probably both play a role.Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms such as a runny nose; sneezing; itching; rashes; swelling; or asthma. Allergies can range from minor to severe.  Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction that can be life-threatening.   Doctors use skin and blood tests to diagnose allergies. Treatments include medicines; allergy shots; and avoiding the substances that cause the reactions.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
High Blood Pressure,https://medlineplus.gov/highbloodpressure.html,Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats; it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats; pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest; between beats; your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. A reading of119/79 or lower is normal blood pressure140/90 or higher is high blood pressureBetween 120 and 139 for the top number; or between 80 and 89 for the bottom number is called prehypertension. Prehypertension means you may end up with high blood pressure; unless you take steps to prevent it.High blood pressure usually has no symptoms; but it can cause serious problems such as stroke; heart failure; heart attack and kidney failure.You can control high blood pressure through healthy lifestyle habits such as exercise and the DASH diet and taking medicines; if needed. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Pulmonary Hypertension,https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryhypertension.html,Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs. It is a serious condition. If you have it; the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your lungs become hard and narrow. Your heart has to work harder to pump the blood through. Over time; your heart weakens and cannot do its job and you can develop heart failure. Symptoms of PH  includeShortness of breath during routine activity; such as climbing two flights of stairsTirednessChest painA racing heartbeatPain on the upper right side of the abdomenDecreased appetiteAs PH worsens; you may find it hard to do any physical activities.There are two main kinds of PH. One runs in families or appears for no known reason. The other kind is related to another condition; usually heart or lung disease. There is no cure for PH. Treatments can control symptoms.  They involve treating the heart or lung disease; medicines; oxygen; and sometimes lung transplantation.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Hyperthyroidism,https://medlineplus.gov/hyperthyroidism.html,Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck; just above your collarbone. It is one of your endocrine glands; which make hormones. Thyroid hormones control the rate of many activities in your body. These include how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats. All of these activities are your body's metabolism. If your thyroid is too active; it makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs. This is called hyperthyroidism.Hyperthyroidism is more common in women; people with other thyroid problems; and those over 60 years old. Graves' disease; an autoimmune disorder; is the most common cause.  Other causes include thyroid nodules; thyroiditis; consuming too much iodine; and taking too much synthetic thyroid hormone.The symptoms can vary from person to person.  They may includeBeing nervous or irritableMood swingsFatigue or muscle weaknessHeat intoleranceTrouble sleepingHand tremorsRapid and irregular heartbeatFrequent bowel movements or diarrheaWeight lossGoiter; which is an enlarged thyroid that may cause the neck to look swollenTo diagnose hyperthyroidism; your doctor will do a physical exam; look at your symptoms; and do thyroid tests. Treatment is with medicines; radioiodine therapy; or thyroid surgery. No single treatment works for everyone.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Triglycerides,https://medlineplus.gov/triglycerides.html,Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood.

Scars,https://medlineplus.gov/scars.html,A scar is a permanent patch of skin that grows over a wound. It forms when your body heals itself after a cut; scrape; burn; or sore. You can also get scars from surgery that cuts through the skin; infections like chickenpox; or skin conditions like acne. Scars are often thicker; as well as pinker; redder; or shinier; than the rest of your skin. How your scar looks depends onHow big and deep your wound isWhere it is How long it takes to heal Your ageYour inherited tendency to scarScars usually fade over time but never go away completely. If the way a scar looks bothers you; various treatments might minimize it. These include surgical revision; dermabrasion; laser treatments; injections; chemical peels; and creams.
Gout,https://medlineplus.gov/gout.html,Gout is a common; painful form of arthritis. It causes swollen; red; hot and stiff joints.Gout happens when uric acid builds up in your body.  Uric acid comes from the breakdown of substances called purines. Purines are in your body's tissues and in foods; such as liver; dried beans and peas; and anchovies. Normally; uric acid dissolves in the blood. It passes through the kidneys and out of the body in urine. But sometimes uric acid can build up and form needle-like crystals. When they form in your joints; it is very painful. The crystals can also cause kidney stones.Often; gout first attacks your big toe. It can also attack ankles; heels; knees; wrists; fingers; and elbows. At first; gout attacks usually get better in days. Eventually; attacks last longer and happen more often.You are more likely to get gout if youAre a manHave family member with goutAre overweightDrink alcoholEat too many foods rich in purinesGout can be hard to diagnose. Your doctor may take a sample of fluid from an inflamed joint to look for crystals. You can treat gout with medicines.Pseudogout has similar symptoms and is sometimes confused with gout.  However; it is caused by calcium phosphate; not uric acid.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases

Hypoglycemia,https://medlineplus.gov/hypoglycemia.html,Hypoglycemia means low blood glucose; or blood sugar. Your body needs glucose to have enough energy. After you eat; your blood absorbs glucose. If you eat more sugar than your body needs; your muscles; and liver store the extra. When your blood sugar begins to fall; a hormone tells your liver to release glucose.In most people; this raises blood sugar. If it doesn't; you have hypoglycemia; and your blood sugar can be dangerously low. Signs include HungerShakinessDizzinessConfusionDifficulty speakingFeeling anxious or weakIn people with diabetes; hypoglycemia is often a side effect of diabetes medicines. Eating or drinking something with carbohydrates can help. If it happens often; your health care provider may need to change your treatment plan.You can also have low blood sugar without having diabetes.  Causes include certain medicines or diseases; hormone or enzyme deficiencies; and tumors. Laboratory tests can help find the cause. The kind of treatment depends on why you have low blood sugar.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Diabetes Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetesmedicines.html,Diabetes means your blood glucose; or blood sugar; levels are too high. If you can't control your diabetes with wise food choices and physical activity; you may need diabetes medicines. The kind of medicine you take depends on your type of diabetes; your schedule; and your other health conditions. With type 1 diabetes; your pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin; too much glucose stays in your blood. If you have type 1 diabetes; you will need to take insulin. Type 2 diabetes; the most common type; can start when the body doesn't use insulin as it should. If your body can't keep up with the need for insulin; you may need to take pills.  Along with meal planning and physical activity; diabetes pills help people with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes keep their blood glucose levels on target. Several kinds of pills are available. Each works in a different way. Many people take two or three kinds of pills. Some people take combination pills. Combination pills contain two kinds of diabetes medicine in one tablet. Some people take pills and insulin.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Sodium,https://medlineplus.gov/sodium.html,Table salt is a combination of two minerals - sodium and chloride Your body needs some sodium to work properly. It helps with the function of nerves and muscles. It also helps to keep the right balance of fluids in your body. Your kidneys control how much sodium is in your body. If you have too much and your kidneys can't get rid it; sodium builds up in your blood. This can lead to high blood pressure. High blood pressure can lead to other health problems.Most people in the U.S. get more sodium in their diets than they need. A key to healthy eating is choosing foods low in sodium. The Dietary Guidelines recommend that most adults eat less than 2.3 grams per day. That equals about 1 teaspoon of table salt a day. Some people are more sensitive to the effects of salt than others and should eat less. This includes people who have high blood pressure; diabetes; or kidney problems; or are African-American or over age 50. Reading food labels can help you see how much sodium is in prepared foods.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

Low Blood Pressure,https://medlineplus.gov/lowbloodpressure.html,You've probably heard that high blood pressure is a problem. Sometimes blood pressure that is too low can also cause problems.Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats; it pumps out blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats; pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest; between beats; your blood pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually they're written one above or before the other; such as 120/80. If your blood pressure reading is 90/60 or lower; you have low blood pressure. Some people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no symptoms and their low readings are normal for them. In other people; blood pressure drops below normal because of a medical condition or certain medicines. Some people may have symptoms of low blood pressure when standing up too quickly.  Low blood pressure is a problem only if it causes dizziness; fainting or in extreme cases; shock.

Hypothermia,https://medlineplus.gov/hypothermia.html,Cold weather can affect your body in different ways. You can get frostbite; which is an injury to the body that is caused by freezing. Your body can also lose heat faster than you can produce it. That can cause hypothermia; or abnormally low body temperature. It can make you sleepy; confused; and clumsy. Because it happens gradually and affects your thinking; you may not realize you need help. That makes it especially dangerous. A body temperature below 95 F is a medical emergency and can lead to death if not treated promptly. Anyone who spends much time outdoors in cold weather can get hypothermia. You can also get it from being cold and wet; or under cold water for too long. Babies and old people are especially at risk. Babies can get it from sleeping in a cold room.

Thyroid hormones control the rate of many activities in your body. These include how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats. All of these activities are your body's metabolism.  If your thyroid gland is not active enough; it does not make enough thyroid hormone to meet your body's needs. This condition is hypothyroidism.Hypothyroidism is more common in women; people with other thyroid problems; and those over 60 years old. Hashimoto's disease; an autoimmune disorder; is the most common cause.  Other causes include thyroid nodules; thyroiditis; congenital hypothyroidism; surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid; radiation treatment of the thyroid; and some medicines.The symptoms can vary from person to person.  They may includeFatigueWeight gainA puffy faceCold intoleranceJoint and muscle painConstipationDry skinDry; thinning hairDecreased sweatingHeavy or irregular menstrual periods and fertility problemsDepressionSlowed heart rateTo diagnose hypothyroidism; your doctor will do a physical exam; look at your symptoms; and do thyroid tests. Treatment is with synthetic thyroid hormone; taken every day.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Hysterectomy,https://medlineplus.gov/hysterectomy.html,A hysterectomy is surgery to remove a woman's uterus or womb. The uterus is the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant.

If you have both ovaries taken out; you will enter menopause.Your health care provider might recommend a hysterectomy if you haveFibroids Endometriosis that hasn't been cured by medicine or surgeryUterine prolapse -  when the uterus drops into the vagina Cancer of the uterine; cervix; or ovariesVaginal bleeding that persists despite treatment  Chronic pelvic pain; as a last resort Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Irritable Bowel Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/irritablebowelsyndrome.html,Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a problem that affects the large intestine. It can cause abdominal cramping; bloating; and a change in bowel habits. Some people with the disorder have constipation. Some have diarrhea. Others go back and forth between the two. Although IBS can cause a great deal of discomfort; it does not harm the intestines.IBS is  common. It affects about twice as many women as men and is most often found in people younger than 45 years.  No one knows the exact cause of IBS.  There is no specific test for it. Your doctor may run tests to be sure you don't have other diseases. These tests may include stool sampling tests; blood tests; and x-rays. Your doctor may also do a test called a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.  Most people diagnosed with IBS can control their symptoms with diet; stress management; probiotics; and medicine.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Jaundice,https://medlineplus.gov/jaundice.html,Jaundice causes your skin and the whites of your eyes to turn yellow. Too much bilirubin causes jaundice.  Bilirubin is a yellow chemical in hemoglobin; the substance that carries oxygen in your red blood cells. As red blood cells break down; your body builds new cells to replace them. The old ones are processed by the liver. If the liver cannot handle the blood cells as they break down; bilirubin builds up in the body and your skin may look yellow. Many healthy babies have some jaundice during the first week of life.  It usually goes away.   However; jaundice can happen at any age and may be a sign of a problem.  Jaundice can happen for many reasons; such asBlood diseasesGenetic syndromesLiver diseases; such as hepatitis or cirrhosisBlockage of bile ducts Infections Medicines

It involves close; constant attention by a team of specially-trained health care  providers.  Critical care usually takes place in an intensive care unit (ICU) or trauma center.Monitors; intravenous (IV) tubes; feeding tubes; catheters; breathing machines; and other equipment are common in critical care units.  They can keep a person alive; but can also increase the risk of infection.Many patients in critical care recover; but some die. Having advance directives in place is important. They help health care providers and family members make end-of-life decisions if you are not able to make them.
Ostomy,https://medlineplus.gov/ostomy.html,An ostomy is surgery to create an opening (stoma) from an area inside the body to the outside. It treats certain diseases of the digestive or urinary systems. It can be permanent; when an organ must be removed.  It can be temporary; when the organ needs time to heal.  The organ could be the small intestine; colon; rectum; or bladder. With an ostomy; there must be a new way for wastes to leave the body. There are many different types of ostomy. Some examples areIleostomy - the bottom of the small intestine (ileum) is attached to the stoma. This bypasses the colon; rectum and anus.Colostomy - the colon is attached to the stoma. This bypasses the rectum and the anus. Urostomy - the tubes that carry urine to the bladder are attached to the stoma. This bypasses the bladder.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Immune System and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/immunesystemanddisorders.html,Your immune system is a complex network of cells; tissues; and organs that work together to defend against germs. It helps your body to recognize these "foreign" invaders. Then its job is to keep them out; or if it can't; to find and destroy them.If your immune system cannot do its job; the results can be serious. Disorders of the immune system includeAllergy and asthma - immune responses to substances that are usually not harmfulImmune deficiency diseases - disorders in which the immune system is missing one or more of its partsAutoimmune diseases - diseases causing your immune system to attack your own body's cells and tissues by mistakeNIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Immunization,https://medlineplus.gov/immunization.html,Shots may hurt a little; but the diseases they can prevent are a lot worse.  Some are even life-threatening. Immunization shots; or vaccinations; are essential. They protect against things like measles; mumps; rubella; hepatitis B; polio; tetanus; diphtheria; and pertussis (whooping cough). Immunizations are important for adults as well as children.Your immune system helps your body fight germs by producing substances to combat them. Once it does; the immune system "remembers" the germ and can fight it again. Vaccines contain germs that have been killed or weakened. When given to a healthy person; the vaccine triggers the immune system to respond and thus build immunity. Before vaccines; people became immune only by actually getting a disease and surviving it. Immunizations are an easier and less risky way to become immune. NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Childhood Immunization,https://medlineplus.gov/childhoodimmunization.html,Today; children in the United States routinely get vaccines that protect them from more than a dozen diseases such as measles; polio; tetanus; diphtheria; and pertussis (whooping cough). Most of these diseases are now at their lowest levels in history; thanks to years of immunization. Children must get at least some vaccines before they may attend school.Vaccines help make you immune to serious diseases without getting sick first. Without a vaccine; you must actually get a disease in order to become immune to the germ that causes it. Vaccines work best when they are given at certain ages. For example; children don't receive measles vaccine until they are at least one year old. If it is given earlier it might not work as well.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes a schedule for childhood vaccines.Although some of the vaccines you receive as a child provide protection for many years; adults need immunizations too.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Tooth Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/toothdisorders.html,Your teeth are made of a hard; bonelike material. Inside the tooth are nerves and blood vessels. You need your teeth for many activities you may take for granted. These include eating; speaking and even smiling. But tooth disorders are nothing to smile about.  They include problems such as cavities (also known as tooth decay); infections; and injuries.  The most familiar symptom of a tooth problem is a toothache. Others include worn-down or loose teeth. It's important that you see a dentist if you have any problems with your teeth. Fortunately; you can prevent many tooth disorders by taking care of your teeth and keeping them clean.
Impaired Driving,https://medlineplus.gov/impaireddriving.html,Impaired driving is dangerous. It's the cause of more than half of all car crashes.  It means operating a motor vehicle while you are affected byAlcoholLegal or illegal drugsSleepinessDistractions; such as using a cell phone or textingHaving a medical condition which affects your drivingFor your safety and the safety of others; do not drive while impaired.  Have someone else drive you or take public transportation when you cannot drive. If you need to take a call or send a text message; pull over.  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
Impetigo,https://medlineplus.gov/impetigo.html,Impetigo is a skin infection caused by bacteria. It is usually caused by staphylococcal (staph) bacteria; but it can also be caused by streptococcal (strep) bacteria. It is most common in children between the ages of two and six. It usually starts when bacteria get into a break in the skin; such as a cut; scratch; or insect bite. Symptoms start with red or pimple-like sores surrounded by red skin. These sores can be anywhere; but usually they occur on your face; arms and legs. The sores fill with pus; then break open after a few days and form a thick crust. They are often itchy; but scratching them can spread the sores. Impetigo can spread by contact with sores or nasal discharge from an infected person. You can treat impetigo with antibiotics. NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Pacemakers and Implantable Defibrillators,https://medlineplus.gov/pacemakersandimplantabledefibrillators.html,An arrhythmia is any disorder of your heart rate or rhythm. It means that your heart beats too quickly; too slowly; or with an irregular pattern. Most arrhythmias result from problems in the electrical system of the heart. If your arrhythmia is serious; you may need a cardiac pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).  They are devices that are implanted in your chest or abdomen.A pacemaker helps control abnormal heart rhythms. It uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. It can speed up a slow heart rhythm; control a fast heart rhythm; and coordinate the chambers of the heart.An ICD monitors heart rhythms. If it senses dangerous rhythms; it delivers shocks. This treatment is called defibrillation. An ICD can help control life-threatening arrhythmias; especially those that can cause sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Most new ICDs can act as both a pacemaker and a defibrillator. Many ICDs also record the heart's electrical patterns when there is an abnormal heartbeat. This can help the doctor plan future treatment.Getting a pacemaker or ICD requires minor surgery. You usually need to stay in the hospital for a day or two; so your doctor can make sure that the device is working well. You will probably be back to your normal activities within a few days.
Erectile Dysfunction,https://medlineplus.gov/erectiledysfunction.html,Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common type of male sexual dysfunction. It is when a man has trouble getting or keeping an erection. ED becomes more common as you get older.  But it's not a natural part of aging.Some people have trouble speaking with their doctors about sex. But if you have ED; you should tell your doctor. ED can be a sign of health problems. It may mean your blood vessels are clogged. It may mean you have nerve damage from diabetes. If you don't see your doctor; these problems will go untreated. Your doctor can offer several new treatments for ED. For many men; the answer is as simple as taking a pill. Getting more exercise; losing weight; or stopping smoking may also help. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Assisted Reproductive Technology,https://medlineplus.gov/assistedreproductivetechnology.html,Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is used to treat infertility. It includes fertility treatments that handle both a woman's egg and a man's sperm. It works by removing eggs from a woman's body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman's body. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most common and effective type of ART. ART procedures sometimes use donor eggs; donor sperm; or previously frozen embryos. It may also involve a surrogate or gestational carrier. A surrogate is a woman who becomes pregnant with sperm from the male partner of the couple. A gestational carrier becomes pregnant with an egg from the female partner and the sperm from the male partner. The most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. It can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are put into the woman's body.
Home Care Services,https://medlineplus.gov/homecareservices.html,Home care is care that allows a person with special needs stay in their home. It might be for people who are getting older; are chronically ill; recovering from surgery; or disabled. Home care services includePersonal care; such as help with bathing; washing your hair; or getting dressedHomemaking; such as cleaning; yard work; and laundryCooking or delivering mealsHealth care; such as having a home health aide come to your homeYou can get almost any type of help you want in your home. Some types of care and community services are free or donated. Many other types you have to pay for. Sometimes government programs or your health insurance will help cover the cost of certain home care services.
Urinary Incontinence,https://medlineplus.gov/urinaryincontinence.html,Urinary incontinence (UI) is loss of bladder control. Symptoms can range from mild leaking to uncontrollable wetting. It can happen to anyone; but it becomes more common with age. Women experience UI twice as often as men.Most bladder control problems happen when muscles are too weak or too active. If the muscles that keep your bladder closed are weak; you may have accidents when you sneeze; laugh or lift a heavy object. This is stress incontinence. If bladder muscles become too active; you may feel a strong urge to go to the bathroom when you have little urine in your bladder. This is urge incontinence or overactive bladder.  There are other causes of incontinence; such as prostate problems and nerve damage.Treatment depends on the type of problem you have and what best fits your lifestyle. It may include simple exercises; medicines; special devices or procedures prescribed by your doctor; or surgery. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Indigestion,https://medlineplus.gov/indigestion.html,Nearly everyone has had indigestion at one time. It's a feeling of discomfort or a burning feeling in your upper abdomen. You may have heartburn or belch and feel bloated. You may also feel nauseated; or even throw up.You might get indigestion from eating too much or too fast; eating high-fat foods; or eating when you're stressed. Smoking; drinking too much alcohol; using some medicines; being tired; and having ongoing stress can also cause indigestion or make it worse. Sometimes the cause is a problem with the digestive tract; like an ulcer or GERD.Avoiding foods and situations that seem to cause it may help. Because indigestion can be a sign of a more serious problem; see your health care provider if it lasts for more than two weeks or if you have severe pain or other symptoms. Your health care provider may use x-rays; lab tests; and an upper endoscopy to diagnose the cause.  You may need medicines to treat the symptoms.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Indoor Air Pollution,https://medlineplus.gov/indoorairpollution.html,We usually think of air pollution as being outdoors; but the air in your house or office could also be polluted. Sources of indoor pollution includeMold and pollenTobacco smokeHousehold products and pesticidesGases such as radon and carbon monoxide  Materials used in the building such as asbestos; formaldehyde and lead Sometimes a group of people have symptoms that seem to be linked to time spent in a certain building. There may be a specific cause; such as Legionnaire's disease. Sometimes the cause of the illness cannot be found. This is known as sick building syndrome.Usually indoor air quality problems only cause discomfort. Most people feel better as soon as they remove the source of the pollution.  However; some pollutants can cause diseases that show up much later; such as respiratory diseases or cancer.Making sure that your building is well-ventilated and getting rid of pollutants can improve the quality of your indoor air.Environmental Protection Agency
Infant and Newborn Care,https://medlineplus.gov/infantandnewborncare.html,Going home with a new baby is exciting; but it can be scary; too. Newborns have many needs; like frequent feedings and diaper changes. Babies can have health issues that are different from older children and adults; like diaper rash and cradle cap.  Your baby will go through many changes during the first year of life. You may feel uneasy at first. Ask your health care provider for help if you need it.
Infant and Newborn Development,https://medlineplus.gov/infantandnewborndevelopment.html,When will my baby take his first step or say her first word? During their first year; babies start to develop skills they will use for the rest of their lives. The normal growth of babies can be broken down into the following areas:  Gross motor - controlling the head; sitting; crawling; maybe even starting to walk Fine motor - holding a spoon; picking up a piece of cereal between thumb and finger Sensory - seeing; hearing; tasting; touching and smelling Language - starting to make sounds; learning some words;  understanding what people say  Social - the ability to play with family members and other children  Babies do not develop at the same rate. There is a wide range of what is considered "normal." Your baby may be ahead in some areas and slightly behind in others. If you are worried about possible delays; talk to your baby's health care provider.
Infant and Newborn Nutrition,https://medlineplus.gov/infantandnewbornnutrition.html,Food provides the energy and nutrients that babies need to be healthy. For a baby; breast milk is best. It has all the necessary vitamins and minerals. Infant formulas  are available for babies whose mothers are not able or decide not to breastfeed.Infants usually start eating solid foods between 4 and 6 months of age.  Check with your health care provider for the best time for your baby to start. If you introduce one new food at a time; you will be able to identify any foods that cause allergies in your baby. Some foods to stay away from includeEggsHoneyPeanuts (including peanut butter)Other tree nuts
Polio and Post-Polio Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/polioandpostpoliosyndrome.html,Polio is an infectious disease caused by a virus. The virus lives in an infected person's throat and intestines. It is most often spread by contact with the stool of an infected person. You can also get it from droplets if an infected person sneezes or coughs. It can contaminate food and water if people do not wash their hands.Most people have no symptoms. If you have symptoms; they may include fever; fatigue; nausea; headache; flu-like symptoms; stiff neck and back; and pain in the limbs. A few people will become paralyzed. There is no treatment to reverse the paralysis of polio. Some people who've had polio develop post-polio syndrome (PPS) years later.  Symptoms include tiredness; new muscle weakness; and muscle and joint pain. There is no way to prevent or cure PPS.The polio vaccine has wiped out polio in the United States and most other countries.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Infection Control,https://medlineplus.gov/infectioncontrol.html,Every year; lives are lost because of the spread of infections in hospitals. Health care workers can take steps to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. These steps are part of infection control.Proper hand washing is the most effective way to prevent the spread of infections in hospitals. If you are a patient; don't be afraid to remind friends; family and health care providers to wash their hands before getting close to you.Other steps health care workers can take includeCovering coughs and sneezesStaying up-to-date with immunizationsUsing gloves; masks and protective clothingMaking tissues and hand cleaners available Following hospital guidelines when dealing with blood or contaminated items
Infections and Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/infectionsandpregnancy.html,If you are pregnant; an infection can be more than just a problem for you. Some infections can be dangerous to your baby. You can help yourself avoid infections:Don't eat raw or undercooked meatDon't share food or drinks with other peopleWash your hands frequentlyDon't empty cat litter. Cats can transmit toxoplasmosis.You may need to take medicines or get a vaccine to prevent an infection in your baby. For example; you may need to take antibiotics if you develop an infection with group B strep; or take medicines if you have genital herpes. Only some medicines and vaccines are safe during pregnancy. Ask your health care provider about how best to protect you and your baby.
Bacterial Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/bacterialinfections.html,Bacteria are living things that have only one cell.  Under a microscope; they look like balls; rods; or spirals. They are so small that a line of 1;000 could fit across a pencil eraser. Most bacteria won't hurt you - less than 1 percent of the different types make people sick. Many are helpful. Some bacteria help to digest food; destroy disease-causing cells; and give the body needed vitamins. Bacteria are also used in making healthy foods like yogurt and cheese.But infectious bacteria can make you ill. They reproduce quickly in your body. Many give off chemicals called toxins; which can damage tissue and make you sick. Examples of bacteria that cause infections include Streptococcus; Staphylococcus; and E. coli.Antibiotics are the usual treatment. When you take antibiotics; follow the directions carefully. Each time you take antibiotics; you increase the chances that bacteria in your body will learn to resist them causing antibiotic resistance. Later; you could get or spread an infection that those antibiotics cannot cure.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Urinary Tract Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/urinarytractinfections.html,The urinary system is the body's drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. It includes two kidneys; two ureters; a bladder; and a urethra. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common type of infection in the body.You may have a UTI if you noticePain or burning when you urinateFever; tiredness; or shakinessAn urge to urinate oftenPressure in your lower belly Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy or reddishPain in your back or side below the ribsPeople of any age or sex can get UTIs. But about four times as many women get UTIs as men. You're also at higher risk if you have diabetes; need a tube to drain your bladder; or have a spinal cord injury.If you think you have a UTI it is important to see your doctor. Your doctor can tell if you have a UTI with a urine test.  Treatment is with antibiotics. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Fungal Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/fungalinfections.html,If you have ever had athlete's foot or a yeast infection; you can blame a fungus. A fungus is a primitive organism. Mushrooms; mold and mildew are examples. Fungi live in air; in soil; on plants and in water. Some live in the human body. Only about half of all types of fungi are harmful.Some fungi reproduce through tiny spores in the air. You can inhale the spores or they can land on you. As a result; fungal infections often start in the lungs or on the skin. You are more likely to get a fungal infection if you have a weakened immune system or take antibiotics.Fungi can be difficult to kill. For skin and nail infections; you can apply medicine directly to the infected area. Oral antifungal medicines are also available for serious infections.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Viral Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/viralinfections.html,Viruses are very tiny germs. They are made of genetic material inside of a protein coating. Viruses cause familiar infectious diseases such as the common cold; flu and warts. They also cause severe illnesses such as HIV/AIDS; smallpox; and Ebola.Viruses are like hijackers. They invade living; normal cells and use those cells to multiply and produce other viruses like themselves. This can kill; damage; or change the cells and make you sick. Different viruses attack certain cells in your body such as your liver; respiratory system; or blood.When you get a virus; you may not always get sick from it. Your immune system may be able to fight it off.For most viral infections; treatments can only help with symptoms while you wait for your immune system to fight off the virus. Antibiotics do not work for viral infections. There are antiviral medicines to treat some viral infections. Vaccines can help prevent you from getting many viral diseases.
Infectious Arthritis,https://medlineplus.gov/infectiousarthritis.html,Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet; such as your elbow or knee.  Infectious arthritis is an infection in the joint. The infection comes from a bacterial; viral; or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body.  Symptoms of infectious arthritis includeIntense pain in the jointJoint redness and swellingChills and feverInability to move the area with the infected jointOne type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. The reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee; ankle; or toe.  Sometimes; reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder; or in the urethra; which carries urine out of the body. In women; an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. For both men and women; it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. Another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it.To diagnose infectious arthritis; your health care provider may do tests of your blood; urine; and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery.
Infectious Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/infectiousdiseases.html,Infectious diseases kill more people worldwide than any other single cause. Infectious diseases are caused by germs. Germs are tiny living things that are found everywhere - in air; soil and water. You can get infected by touching; eating; drinking or breathing something that contains a germ.  Germs can also spread through animal and insect bites; kissing and sexual contact. Vaccines; proper hand washing and medicines can help prevent infections. There are four main kinds of germs:  Bacteria - one-celled germs that multiply quickly and may release chemicals which can make you sick Viruses - capsules that contain genetic material; and use your own cells to multiply Fungi - primitive plants; like mushrooms or mildew  Protozoa - one-celled animals that use other living things for food and a place to liveNIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Infectious Mononucleosis,https://medlineplus.gov/infectiousmononucleosis.html,Infectious mononucleosis; or "mono"; is an infection usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. The virus spreads through saliva; which is why it's sometimes called "kissing disease." Mono occurs most often in teens and young adults. However; you can get it at any age.  Symptoms of mono includeFeverSore throatSwollen lymph glandsSometimes you may also have a swollen spleen.  Serious problems are rare. A blood test can show if you have mono. Most people get better in two to four weeks. However; you may feel tired for a few months afterward. Treatment focuses on helping symptoms and includes medicines for pain and fever; warm salt water gargles and plenty of rest and fluids.
Infertility,https://medlineplus.gov/infertility.html,Infertility means not being able to become pregnant after a year of trying. If a woman can get pregnant but keeps having miscarriages or stillbirths; that's also called infertility.Infertility is fairly common. After one year of having unprotected sex; about 15 percent of couples are unable to get pregnant. About a third of the time; infertility can be traced to the woman. In another third of cases; it is because of the man. The rest of the time; it is because of both partners or no cause can be found.There are treatments that are specifically for men or for women. Some involve both partners. Drugs; assisted reproductive technology; and surgery are common treatments. Happily; many couples treated for infertility go on to have babies.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Female Infertility,https://medlineplus.gov/femaleinfertility.html,Infertility means not being able to get pregnant after at least one year of trying (or 6 months if the woman is over age 35). If a woman keeps having miscarriages; it is also called infertility.  Female infertility can result from age; physical problems; hormone problems; and lifestyle or environmental factors.Most cases of infertility in women result from problems with producing eggs. In premature ovarian failure; the ovaries stop functioning before natural menopause.  In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); the ovaries may not release an egg regularly or they may not release a healthy egg.About a third of the time; infertility is because of a problem with the woman. One third of the time; it is a problem with the man. Sometimes no cause can be found.If you think you might be infertile; see your doctor. There are tests that may tell if you have fertility problems. When it is possible to find the cause; treatments may include medicines; surgery; or assisted reproductive technologies. Happily; many couples treated for infertility are able to have babies.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Male Infertility,https://medlineplus.gov/maleinfertility.html,Infertility is a term doctors use if a man hasn't been able to get a woman pregnant after at least one year of trying. Causes of male infertility includePhysical problems with the testiclesBlockages in the ducts that carry spermHormone problemsA history of high fevers or mumpsGenetic disordersLifestyle or environmental factorsAbout a third of the time; infertility is because of a problem with the man. One third of the time; it is a problem with the woman. Sometimes no cause can be found.If you suspect you are infertile; see your doctor. There are tests that may tell if you have fertility problems. When it is possible to find the cause; treatments may include medicines; surgery; or assisted reproductive technology. Happily; many couples treated for infertility are able to have babies.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Crohn's Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/crohnsdisease.html,Crohn's disease causes inflammation of the digestive system.  It is one of a group of diseases called inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn's can affect any area from the mouth to the anus. It often affects the lower part of the small intestine called the ileum.The cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. It may be due to an abnormal reaction by the body's immune system.  It also seems to run in some families. It most commonly starts between the ages of 13 and 30.The most common symptoms are pain in the abdomen and diarrhea. Other symptoms includeBleeding from the rectumWeight lossFeverYour doctor will diagnose Crohn's disease with a physical exam; lab tests; imaging tests; and a colonoscopy.Crohn's can cause complications; such as intestinal blockages; ulcers in the intestine; and problems getting enough nutrients. People with Crohn's can also have joint pain and skin problems. Children with the disease may have growth problems.There is no cure for Crohn's. Treatment can help control symptoms; and may include medicines; nutrition supplements; and/or surgery. Some people have long periods of remission; when they are free of symptoms.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Ulcerative Colitis,https://medlineplus.gov/ulcerativecolitis.html,Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease that causes inflammation and sores; called ulcers; in the lining of the rectum and colon. It is one of a group of diseases called inflammatory bowel disease.UC can happen at any age; but it usually starts between the ages of 15 and 30. It tends to run in families. The most common symptoms are pain in the abdomen and blood or pus in diarrhea. Other symptoms may includeAnemiaSevere tirednessWeight lossLoss of appetiteBleeding from the rectumSores on the skinJoint painGrowth failure in childrenAbout half of people with UC have mild symptoms.Doctors use blood tests; stool tests; colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy; and imaging tests to diagnose UC. Several types of drugs can help control it. Some people have long periods of remission; when they are free of symptoms. In severe cases; doctors must remove the colon.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Flu,https://medlineplus.gov/flu.html,Flu is a respiratory infection caused by a number of viruses. The viruses pass through the air and enter your body through your nose or mouth. Between 5% and 20% of people in the U.S. get the flu each year.   The flu can be serious or even deadly for elderly people; newborn babies; and people with certain chronic illnesses.Symptoms of the flu come on suddenly and are worse than those of the common cold. They may includeBody or muscle achesChills Cough Fever Headache Sore throat Is it a cold or the flu?  Colds rarely cause a fever or headaches.  Flu almost never causes an upset stomach.  And "stomach flu"  isn't really flu at all; but gastroenteritis.Most people with the flu recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the flu should stay home and avoid contact with others; except to get medical care. If you get the flu; your health care provider may prescribe medicine to help your body fight the infection and lessen symptoms. The main way to keep from getting the flu is to get a yearly flu vaccine. Good hygiene; including hand washing; can also help.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Flu Shot,https://medlineplus.gov/flushot.html,Flu is a respiratory infection caused by a number of viruses. Most people with the flu get better on their own. But it can be serious. It can cause complications and sometimes even death.   Getting the flu vaccine every year is the best way to lower your chance of getting the flu and spreading it to others.The flu vaccine causes antibodies to develop in your body about two weeks after you get it. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine.There are different types of flu shots; including some especially for people 65 and older. Ask your health care provider which one is right for you.Everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every season. People with egg allergies should check with their doctors before getting a vaccine. Other exceptions are people who haveHad reactions to flu shots beforeGuillain-Barre SyndromeA feverCenters for Disease Control and Prevention
Patient Rights,https://medlineplus.gov/patientrights.html,As a patient; you have certain rights.  Some are guaranteed by federal law; such as the right to get a copy of your medical records; and the right to keep them private.  Many states have additional laws protecting patients; and health care facilities often have a patient bill of rights.An important patient right is informed consent.  This means that if you need a treatment; your health care provider must give you the information you need to make a decision.Many hospitals have patient advocates who can help you if you have problems. Many states have an ombudsman office for problems with long term care.  Your state's department of health may also be able to help.
Nail Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/naildiseases.html,Your toenails and fingernails protect the tissues of your toes and fingers. They are made up of layers of a hardened protein called keratin; which is also in your hair and skin. The health of your nails can be a clue to your overall health. Healthy nails are usually smooth and consistent in color. Specific types of nail discoloration and changes in growth rate can be signs of lung; heart; kidney; and liver diseases; as well as diabetes and anemia. White spots and vertical ridges are harmless.Nail problems that sometimes require treatment includeBacterial and fungal infectionsIngrown nailsTumorsWartsKeeping your nails clean; dry; and trimmed can help you avoid some problems. Do not remove the cuticle; which can cause infection.
Hernia,https://medlineplus.gov/hernia.html,A hernia happens when part of an internal organ or tissue bulges through a weak area of muscle. Most hernias are in the abdomen.There are several types of hernias; including Inguinal; in the groin. This is the the most common type. Umbilical; around the belly button Incisional; through a scar Hiatal; a small opening in the diaphragm that allows the upper part of the stomach to move up into the chest. Congenital diaphragmatic; a birth defect that needs surgeryHernias are common. They can affect men; women; and children.  A combination of muscle weakness and straining; such as with heavy lifting; might contribute. Some people are born with weak abdominal muscles and may be more likely to get a hernia.Treatment is usually surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. Untreated hernias can cause pain and health problems.
Inhalants,https://medlineplus.gov/inhalants.html,If you're a parent; you may fear that your kids will use drugs such as marijuana or LSD. But you may not realize the dangers of substances in your own home. Household products such as glues; hair sprays; paints and lighter fluid can be drugs for kids in search of a quick high. Many young people inhale vapors from these; not knowing that it can cause serious health problems.Both parents and kids need to know the dangers. Even inhaling once can disrupt heart rhythms and lower oxygen levels. Either of these can cause death. Regular abuse can result in serious harm to the brain; heart; kidneys; and liver. NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Inhalation Injuries,https://medlineplus.gov/inhalationinjuries.html,There are a variety of substances you can inhale that can cause acute internal injuries.   Particles in the air from fires and toxic fumes can damage your eyes and respiratory system. They also can make chronic heart and lung diseases worse.Symptoms of acute inhalation injuries may includeCoughing and phlegmA scratchy throatIrritated sinusesShortness of breathChest pain or tightnessHeadachesStinging eyesA runny noseIf you already have asthma; it may get worse.The best way to prevent inhalation injuries is to limit your exposure. If you smell or see smoke; or know that fires are nearby; you should leave the area if you are at greater risk from breathing smoke.Environmental Protection Agency
Wounds and Injuries,https://medlineplus.gov/woundsandinjuries.html,An injury is damage to your body. It is a general term that refers to harm caused by accidents; falls; hits; weapons; and more. In the U.S.; millions of people injure themselves every year. These injuries range from minor to life-threatening. Injuries can happen at work or play; indoors or outdoors; driving a car; or walking across the street.Wounds are injuries that break the skin or other body tissues.   They include cuts; scrapes; scratches; and punctured skin. They often happen because of an accident; but surgery; sutures; and stitches also cause wounds. Minor wounds usually aren't serious; but it is important to clean them. Serious and infected wounds may require first aid followed by a visit to your doctor. You should also seek attention if the wound is deep; you cannot close it yourself; you cannot stop the bleeding or get the dirt out; or it does not heal.Other common types of injuries includeAnimal bitesBruisesBurnsDislocationsElectrical injuriesFracturesSprains and strains
Insect Bites and Stings,https://medlineplus.gov/insectbitesandstings.html,Most insect bites are harmless; though they sometimes cause discomfort. Bee; wasp; and hornet stings and fire ant bites usually hurt. Mosquito and flea bites usually itch. Insects can also spread diseases. In the United States; some mosquitoes spread West Nile virus. Travelers outside the United States may be at risk for malaria and other infections. To prevent insect bites and their complicationsDon't bother insectsUse insect repellant Wear protective clothing Be careful when you eat outside because food attracts insectsIf you know you have severe allergic reactions to insect bites and stings (such as anaphylaxis); carry an emergency epinephrine kit

Pesticides,https://medlineplus.gov/pesticides.html,Pests live where they are not wanted or cause harm to crops; people; or animals. Pesticides can help get rid of them. Pesticides are not just insect killers. They also include chemicals to control weeds; rodents; mildew; germs; and more. Many household products contain pesticides.Pesticides can protect your health by killing germs; animals; or plants that could hurt you.  However; they can also be harmful to people or pets. You might want to try non-chemical methods first. If you do need a pesticide; use it correctly. Be especially careful around children and pets. Proper disposal of pesticides is also important - it can help protect the environment.Biologically-based pesticides are becoming more popular. They often are safer than traditional pesticides.Environmental Protection Agency
Insomnia,https://medlineplus.gov/insomnia.html,Insomnia is a common sleep disorder. If you have it; you may have trouble falling asleep; staying asleep; or both. As a result; you may get too little sleep or have poor-quality sleep. You may not feel refreshed when you wake up.Symptoms of insomnia include:Lying awake for a long time before you fall asleepSleeping for only short periodsBeing awake for much of the nightFeeling as if you haven't slept at allWaking up too earlyYour doctor will diagnose insomnia based on your medical and sleep histories and a physical exam. He or she also may recommend a sleep study. A sleep study measures how well you sleep and how your body responds to sleep problems.  Treatments include good sleep habits; counseling; and medicines.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Diabetes Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetesmedicines.html,Diabetes means your blood glucose; or blood sugar; levels are too high. If you can't control your diabetes with wise food choices and physical activity; you may need diabetes medicines. The kind of medicine you take depends on your type of diabetes; your schedule; and your other health conditions. With type 1 diabetes; your pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin; too much glucose stays in your blood. If you have type 1 diabetes; you will need to take insulin. Type 2 diabetes; the most common type; can start when the body doesn't use insulin as it should. If your body can't keep up with the need for insulin; you may need to take pills.  Along with meal planning and physical activity; diabetes pills help people with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes keep their blood glucose levels on target. Several kinds of pills are available. Each works in a different way. Many people take two or three kinds of pills. Some people take combination pills. Combination pills contain two kinds of diabetes medicine in one tablet. Some people take pills and insulin.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Metabolic Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/metabolicsyndrome.html,Metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions that put you at risk for heart disease and diabetes. These conditions are  High blood pressureHigh blood glucose; or blood sugar; levelsHigh levels of triglycerides; a type of fat; in your blood Low levels of HDL; the good cholesterol; in your bloodToo much fat around your waistNot all doctors agree on the definition or cause of metabolic syndrome. The cause might be insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone your body produces to help you turn sugar from food into energy for your body. If you are insulin resistant; too much sugar builds up in your blood; setting the stage for disease.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Prediabetes,https://medlineplus.gov/prediabetes.html,Prediabetes means you have blood glucose; or blood sugar; levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Too much glucose in your blood can damage your body over time. If you have prediabetes; you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes; heart disease; and stroke.Most people with prediabetes don't have any symptoms. Your doctor can use an A1C test or another blood test to find out if your blood glucose levels are higher than normal. If you are 45 years old or older; your doctor may recommend that you be tested for prediabetes; especially if you are overweight.Losing weight - at least 5 to 10 percent of your starting weight - can prevent or delay diabetes or even reverse prediabetes. That's 10 to 20 pounds for someone who weighs 200 pounds. You can lose weight by cutting down on the amount of calories and fat you eat and being physically active at least 30 minutes a day. Being physically active makes your body's insulin work better. Your doctor may also prescribe medicine to help control the amount of glucose in your blood.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Diabetes Type 1,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype1.html,Diabetes means your blood glucose; or blood sugar; levels are too high.  With type 1 diabetes; your pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin; too much glucose stays in your blood.  Over time; high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart; eyes; kidneys; nerves; and gums and teeth. Type 1 diabetes happens most often in children and young adults but can appear at any age. Symptoms may includeBeing very thirsty Urinating often Feeling very hungry or tired Losing weight without trying Having sores that heal slowly Having dry; itchy skin Losing the feeling in your feet or having tingling in your feet Having blurry eyesight A blood test can show if you have diabetes. If you do; you will need to take insulin for the rest of your life. A blood test called the A1C can check to see how well you are managing your diabetes.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Health Insurance,https://medlineplus.gov/healthinsurance.html,Health insurance helps protect you from high medical care costs. It is a contract between you and your insurance company. You buy a plan or policy; and the company agrees to pay part of your expenses when you need medical care.Many people in the United States get a health insurance policy through their employers. In most cases; the employer helps pay for that insurance. Insurance through employers is often with a managed care plan. These plans contract with health care providers and medical facilities to provide care for members at reduced costs. You can also purchase health insurance on your own.People who meet certain requirements can qualify for government health insurance; such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act expands health insurance coverage for many people in the U.S.
Managed Care,https://medlineplus.gov/managedcare.html,Managed care plans are a type of health insurance. They have contracts with health care providers and medical facilities to provide care for members at reduced costs. These providers make up the plan's network. How much of your care the plan will pay for depends on the network's rules.Plans that restrict your choices usually cost you less. If you want a flexible plan; it will probably cost more. There are three types of managed care plans:Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) usually only pay for care within the network. You choose a primary care doctor who coordinates most of your care.Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO) usually pay more if you get care within the network. They still pay part of the cost if you go outside the network.Point of Service (POS) plans let you choose between an HMO or a PPO each time you need care.
Medicaid,https://medlineplus.gov/medicaid.html,Medicaid is government health insurance that helps many low-income people in the United States to pay their medical bills. The Federal government sets up general guidelines for the program; but each state has its own rules. Your state might require you to pay a part of the cost for some medical services. You have to meet certain requirements to get Medicaid help. These might involveYour ageWhether you are pregnant; disabled; or blindYour income and resourcesWhether or not you are a U.S. citizen or; if not; what your immigration status isCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services
Medicare,https://medlineplus.gov/medicare.html,Medicare is the U.S. government's health insurance program for people age 65 or older. Some people under age 65 can qualify for Medicare; too. They include those with disabilities; permanent kidney failure; or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Medicare helps with the cost of health care. It does not cover all medical expenses or the cost of most long-term care. The program has four parts:Part A is hospital insurancePart B helps pay for medical services that Part A doesn't coverPart C is called Medicare Advantage. If you have Parts A and B; you can choose this option to receive all of your health care through a provider organization; like an HMO.Part D is prescription drug coverage. It helps pay for some medicines.
Complementary and Integrative Medicine,https://medlineplus.gov/complementaryandintegrativemedicine.html,Many Americans use medical treatments that are not part of mainstream medicine. When you are using these types of care; it may be called complementary; integrative; or alternative medicine.Complementary medicine is used together with mainstream medical care. An example is using acupuncture to help with side effects of cancer treatment. When health care providers and facilities offer both types of care; it is called integrative medicine. Alternative medicine is used instead of mainstream medical care.The claims that non-mainstream practitioners make can sound promising. However; researchers do not know how safe many of these treatments are or how well they work. Studies are underway to determine the safety and usefulness of many of these practices.To minimize the health risks of a non-mainstream treatmentDiscuss it with your doctor. It might have side effects or interact with other medicines.Find out what the research says about itChoose practitioners carefullyTell all of your doctors and practitioners about all of the different types of treatments you useNIH: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health
Leg Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/leginjuriesanddisorders.html,Your legs are made up of bones; blood vessels; muscles; and other connective tissue. They are important for motion and standing. Playing sports; running; falling; or having an accident can damage your legs. Common leg injuries include sprains and strains; joint dislocations; and fractures.These injuries can affect the entire leg; or just the foot; ankle; knee; or hip. Certain diseases also lead to leg problems. For example; knee osteoarthritis; common in older people; can cause pain and limited motion. Problems in your veins in your legs can lead to varicose veins or deep vein thrombosis.
Peripheral Arterial Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/peripheralarterialdisease.html,Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) happens when there is a narrowing of the blood vessels outside of your heart. The cause of PAD is atherosclerosis. This happens when plaque builds up on the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the arms and legs. Plaque is a substance made up of fat and cholesterol. It causes the arteries to narrow or become blocked. This can reduce or stop blood flow; usually to the legs. If severe enough; blocked blood flow can cause tissue death and can sometimes lead to amputation of the foot or leg.The main risk factor for PAD is smoking. Other risk factors include older age and diseases like diabetes; high blood cholesterol; high blood pressure; heart disease; and stroke.Many people who have PAD don't have any symptoms. If you have symptoms; they may includePain; numbness; achiness; or heaviness in the leg muscles. This happens when walking or climbing stairs.Weak or absent pulses in the legs or feetSores or wounds on the toes; feet; or legs that heal slowly; poorly; or not at allA pale or bluish color to the skinA lower temperature in one leg than the other legPoor nail growth on the toes and decreased hair growth on the legsErectile dysfunction; especially among men who have diabetesPAD can increase your risk of heart attack; stroke; and transient ischemic attack.Doctors diagnose PAD with a physical exam and heart and imaging tests. Treatments include lifestyle changes; medicines; and sometimes surgery. Lifestyle changes include dietary changes; exercise; and efforts to lower high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
International Health,https://medlineplus.gov/internationalhealth.html,The spread of a disease doesn't stop at a country's borders.  With more people traveling to other countries and living in crowded cities; it's easier for germs to spread.  Infectious diseases that start in one part of the world can quickly reach another. Resistance to medicines such as antbiotics is on the rise. This makes it harder to treat certain diseases. Natural and man-made disasters create refugee populations with immediate and long-term health problems.Some of the major diseases currently affecting countries around the globe include HIV/AIDS; malaria; Zika; and tuberculosis.  Climate change is also an international problem which can affect people's health. Many countries and health organizations are working together and sharing information on these and other health issues.
Internet Safety,https://medlineplus.gov/internetsafety.html,For most kids and teens; technology is an important part of their lives.  They browse the Web for information; use social networking sites; text; and chat.  But there can also be dangers; and it is important for parents to monitor their children's use and teach them how to be safe online:  Never give out personal information; such as your full name; address; phone number; or school name Tell an adult if any communication (chat; text; e-mail message) makes you feel threatened or uncomfortable Never send sexually explicit photographs or messages On social networking sites; use privacy controls and only friend people that you know  Of course; some of this advice is good for adults; too.
Interstitial Cystitis,https://medlineplus.gov/interstitialcystitis.html,Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a condition that causes discomfort or pain in the bladder and a need to urinate frequently and urgently. It is far more common in women than in men. The symptoms vary from person to person. Some people may have pain without urgency or frequency. Others have urgency and frequency without pain. Women's symptoms often get worse during their periods. They may also have pain with sexual intercourse.The cause of IC isn't known. There is no one test to tell if you have it.  Doctors often run tests to rule out other possible causes of symptoms. There is no cure for IC; but treatments can help most people feel better. They includeDistending; or inflating; the bladderBathing the inside of the bladder with a drug solutionOral medicinesElectrical nerve stimulationPhysical therapyLifestyle changesBladder trainingIn rare cases; surgeryNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Interstitial Lung Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/interstitiallungdiseases.html,Interstitial lung disease is the name for a large group of diseases that inflame or scar the lungs. The inflammation and scarring make it hard to get enough oxygen. The scarring is called pulmonary fibrosis.Breathing in dust or other particles in the air is responsible for some types of interstitial lung diseases. Specific types includeBlack lung disease among coal miners; from inhaling coal dustFarmer's lung; from inhaling farm dustAsbestosis; from inhaling asbestos fibersSiderosis; from inhaling iron from mines or welding fumesSilicosis; from inhaling silica dustOther causes include autoimmune diseases or occupational exposures to molds; gases; or fumes. Some types of interstitial lung disease have no known cause.Treatment depends on the type of exposure and the stage of the disease. It may involve medicines; oxygen therapy; or a lung transplant in severe cases.

Intestinal Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/intestinalcancer.html,Your small intestine is part of your digestive system.  It is a long tube that connects your stomach to your large intestine. Intestinal cancer is rare; but eating a high-fat diet or having Crohn's disease; celiac disease; or a history of  colonic polyps can increase your risk.Possible signs of small intestine cancer includeAbdominal painWeight loss for no reasonBlood in the stoolA lump in the abdomenImaging tests that create pictures of the small intestine and the area around it can help diagnose intestinal cancer and show whether it has spread.Surgery is the most common treatment. Additional options include chemotherapy; radiation therapy; or a combination.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Colonic Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/colonicdiseases.html,Your colon; also known as the large intestine; is part of your digestive system. It's a long; hollow tube at the end of your digestive tract where your body makes and stores stool. Many disorders affect the colon's ability to work properly. Some of these include  Colorectal cancer   Colonic polyps - extra tissue growing in the colon that can become cancerous  Ulcerative colitis - ulcers of the colon and rectum  Diverticulitis - inflammation or infection of pouches in the colon  Irritable bowel syndrome  -  an uncomfortable condition causing abdominal cramping and other symptoms  Treatment for colonic diseases varies greatly depending on the disease and its severity. Treatment may involve diet; medicines and in some cases; surgery. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Small Intestine Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/smallintestinedisorders.html,Your small intestine is the longest part of your digestive system - about twenty feet long!  It connects your stomach to your large intestine (or colon) and folds many times to fit inside your abdomen. Your small intestine does most of the digesting of the foods you eat.  It has three areas called the duodenum; the ileum; and the jejunum. Problems with the small intestine can include:  Bleeding Celiac disease Crohn's disease Infections Intestinal cancer Intestinal obstruction Irritable bowel syndrome Ulcers; such as peptic ulcer  Treatment of disorders of the small intestine depends on the cause.
Intestinal Obstruction,https://medlineplus.gov/intestinalobstruction.html,An intestinal obstruction occurs when food or stool cannot move through the intestines. The obstruction can be complete or partial. There are many causes. The most common are adhesions; hernias; cancers; and certain medicines.  Symptoms include  Severe abdominal pain or cramping  Vomiting  Bloating  Loud bowel sounds  Swelling of the abdomen  Inability to pass gas  Constipation  A complete intestinal obstruction is a medical emergency.  It often requires surgery. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

It often requires surgery. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Brain Aneurysm,https://medlineplus.gov/brainaneurysm.html,A brain aneurysm is an abnormal bulge or "ballooning" in the wall of an artery in the brain. They are sometimes called berry aneurysms because they are often the size of a small berry. Most brain aneurysms produce no symptoms until they become large; begin to leak blood; or burst.If a brain aneurysm presses on nerves in your brain; it can cause signs and symptoms. These can includeA droopy eyelid Double vision or other changes in vision Pain above or behind the eye A dilated pupil Numbness or weakness on one side of the face or body Treatment depends on the size and location of the aneurysm; whether it is infected; and whether it has burst. If a brain aneurysm bursts; symptoms can include a sudden; severe headache; nausea and vomiting; stiff neck; loss of consciousness; and signs of a stroke. Any of these symptoms requires immediate medical attention.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Cataract,https://medlineplus.gov/cataract.html,A cataract is a clouding of the lens in your eye.  It affects your vision.  Cataracts are very common in older people. By age 80; more than half of all Americans either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery.A cataract can occur in either or both eyes. It cannot spread from one eye to the other. Common symptoms areBlurry visionColors that seem fadedGlare - headlights; lamps or sunlight may seem too bright. You may also see a halo around lights.Not being able to see well at nightDouble vision Frequent prescription changes in your eye wear Cataracts usually develop slowly. New glasses; brighter lighting; anti-glare sunglasses or magnifying lenses can help at first. Surgery is also an option. It involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. Wearing sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block ultraviolet sunlight may help to delay cataracts.NIH: National Eye Institute
Refractive Errors,https://medlineplus.gov/refractiveerrors.html,The cornea and lens of your eye helps you focus.  Refractive errors are vision problems that happen when the shape of the eye keeps you from focusing well. The cause could be the length of the eyeball (longer or shorter); changes in the shape of the cornea; or aging of the lens.Four common refractive errors areMyopia; or nearsightedness - clear vision close up but  blurry in the distanceHyperopia; or farsightedness - clear vision in the distance but blurry close upPresbyopia - inability to focus close up as a result of agingAstigmatism - focus problems caused by the corneaThe most common symptom is blurred vision. Other symptoms may include double vision; haziness; glare or halos around bright lights; squinting; headaches; or eye strain.Glasses or contact lenses can usually correct refractive errors. Laser eye surgery may also be a possibility.NIH: National Eye Institute
Eye Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/eyecancer.html,Cancer of the eye is uncommon. It can affect the outer parts of the eye; such as the eyelid; which are made up of muscles; skin and nerves. If the cancer starts inside the eyeball it's called intraocular cancer. The most common intraocular cancers in adults are melanoma and lymphoma. The most common eye cancer in children is retinoblastoma; which starts in the cells of the retina.  Cancer can also spread to the eye from other parts of the body. Treatment for eye cancer varies by the type and by how advanced it is. It may include surgery; radiation therapy; freezing or heat therapy; or laser therapy.
Melanoma,https://medlineplus.gov/melanoma.html,Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer.  Often the first sign of melanoma is a change in the size; shape; color; or feel of a mole. Most melanomas have a black or black-blue area. Melanoma may also appear as a new mole. It may be black; abnormal; or "ugly looking."Thinking of "ABCDE" can help you remember what to watch for: Asymmetry - the shape of one half does not match the other Border - the edges are ragged; blurred or irregular Color - the color is uneven and may include shades of black; brown and tan Diameter - there is a change in size; usually an increaseEvolving - the mole has changed over the past few weeks or monthsSurgery is the first treatment of all stages of melanoma. Other treatments include chemotherapy and radiation; biologic; and targeted therapies.  Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Intestinal Obstruction,https://medlineplus.gov/intestinalobstruction.html,An intestinal obstruction occurs when food or stool cannot move through the intestines. The obstruction can be complete or partial. There are many causes. The most common are adhesions; hernias; cancers; and certain medicines.

Iron,https://medlineplus.gov/iron.html,Iron is a mineral that our bodies need for many functions. For example; iron is part of hemoglobin; a protein which carries oxygen from our lungs throughout our bodies. It helps our muscles store and use oxygen. Iron is also part of many other proteins and enzymes.Your body needs the right amount of iron. If you have too little iron; you may develop iron deficiency anemia. Causes of low iron levels include blood loss; poor diet; or an inability to absorb enough iron from foods. People at higher risk of having too little iron are young children and women who are pregnant or have periods.Too much iron can damage your body.  Taking too many iron supplements can cause iron poisoning. Some people have an inherited disease called hemochromatosis.  It causes too much iron to build up in the body. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Anemia,https://medlineplus.gov/anemia.html,If you have anemia; your blood does not carry enough oxygen to the rest of your body.  The most common cause of anemia is not having enough iron. Your body needs iron to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives the red color to blood. It carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.Anemia has three main causes: blood loss; lack of red blood cell production; and high rates of red blood cell destruction.Conditions that may lead to anemia includeHeavy periodsPregnancyUlcersColon polyps or colon cancerInherited disordersA diet that does not have enough iron; folic acid or vitamin B12Blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia; or cancerAplastic anemia; a condition that can be inherited or acquiredG6PD deficiency; a metabolic disorderAnemia can make you feel tired; cold; dizzy; and irritable. You may be short of breath or have a headache.Your doctor will diagnose anemia with a physical exam and blood tests. Treatment depends on the kind of anemia you have.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Hemochromatosis,https://medlineplus.gov/hemochromatosis.html,Hemochromatosis is a disease in which too much iron builds up in your body. Your body needs iron but too much of it is toxic. If you have hemochromatosis; you absorb more iron than you need. Your body has no natural way to get rid of the extra iron. It stores it in body tissues; especially the liver; heart; and pancreas. The extra iron can damage your organs. Without treatment; it can cause your organs to fail.There are two types of hemochromatosis. Primary hemochromatosis is an inherited disease. Secondary hemochromatosis is usually the result of something else; such as anemia; thalassemia; liver disease; or blood transfusions.Many symptoms of hemochromatosis are similar to those of other diseases. Not everyone has symptoms. If you do; you may have joint pain; fatigue; general weakness; weight loss; and stomach pain.Your doctor will diagnose hemochromatosis based on your medical and family histories; a physical exam; and the results from tests and procedures. Treatments include removing blood (and iron) from your body; medicines; and changes in your diet.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Arrhythmia,https://medlineplus.gov/arrhythmia.html,An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. It means that your heart beats too quickly; too slowly; or with an irregular pattern. When the heart beats faster than normal; it is called tachycardia. When the heart beats too slowly; it is called bradycardia. The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation; which causes an irregular and fast heart beat.Many factors can affect your heart's rhythm; such as having had a heart attack; smoking; congenital heart defects; and stress. Some substances or medicines may also cause arrhythmias. Symptoms of arrhythmias includeFast or slow heart beatSkipping beatsLightheadedness or dizzinessChest painShortness of breath Sweating Your doctor can run tests to find out if you have an arrhythmia. Treatment to restore a normal heart rhythm may include medicines; an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker; or sometimes surgery. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Irritable Bowel Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/irritablebowelsyndrome.html,Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a problem that affects the large intestine. It can cause abdominal cramping; bloating; and a change in bowel habits. Some people with the disorder have constipation. Some have diarrhea. Others go back and forth between the two. Although IBS can cause a great deal of discomfort; it does not harm the intestines.IBS is  common. It affects about twice as many women as men and is most often found in people younger than 45 years.  No one knows the exact cause of IBS.  There is no specific test for it. Your doctor may run tests to be sure you don't have other diseases. These tests may include stool sampling tests; blood tests; and x-rays. Your doctor may also do a test called a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.  Most people diagnosed with IBS can control their symptoms with diet; stress management; probiotics; and medicine.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Ischemic Stroke,https://medlineplus.gov/ischemicstroke.html,A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is the most common type. It is usually caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This keeps blood from flowing to the brain. Within minutes; brain cells begin to die.  Another cause is stenosis; or narrowing of the artery. This can happen because of atherosclerosis; a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke.Symptoms of stroke areSudden numbness or weakness of the face; arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)Sudden confusion; trouble speaking or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden trouble walking; dizziness; loss of balance or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeIt is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. Blood thinners may be used to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot. Post-stroke rehabilitation can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Pancreatic Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/pancreaticcancer.html,The pancreas is a gland behind your stomach and in front of your spine. It produces the juices that help break down food and the hormones that help control blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer usually begins in the cells that produce the juices. Some risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer includeSmoking Long-term diabetes Chronic pancreatitis Certain hereditary disorders Pancreatic cancer is hard to catch early. It doesn't cause symptoms right away. When you do get symptoms; they are often vague or you may not notice them. They include yellowing of the skin and eyes; pain in the abdomen and back; weight loss and fatigue. Also; because the pancreas is hidden behind other organs; health care providers cannot see or feel the tumors during routine exams. Doctors use a physical exam; blood tests; imaging tests; and a biopsy to diagnose it.Because it is often found late and it spreads quickly; pancreatic cancer can be hard to treat.  Possible treatments include surgery; radiation; chemotherapy; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Islet Cell Transplantation,https://medlineplus.gov/isletcelltransplantation.html,Islets are cells found in clusters throughout the pancreas. They are made up of several types of cells. One of these is beta cells; which make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. Islet cell transplantation transfers cells from an organ donor into the body of another person. It is an experimental treatment for type 1 diabetes.In type 1 diabetes; the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin. A person who has type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily to live. Transplanted islet cells; however; can take over the work of the destroyed cells. The beta cells in these islets will begin to make and release insulin.

Itching,https://medlineplus.gov/itching.html,Itching is skin tingling or irritation that makes you want to scratch the itchy area. It's a symptom of many health conditions. Common causes are   Allergic reactions  Eczema Dry skin  Insect bites and stings Irritating chemicals Parasites such as pinworms; scabies; head and body lice Pregnancy  Rashes  Reactions to medicines  To soothe itchy skin; you can try cold compresses; lotions and lukewarm baths. Avoid scratching; wearing irritating fabrics and high heat and humidity. Most itching is not serious. However; if you itch all over; have hives that keep coming back or have itching without an apparent cause; you might require medical attention.
Birth Control,https://medlineplus.gov/birthcontrol.html,Birth control; also known as contraception; is designed to prevent pregnancy. Birth control methods may work in a number of different ways:Preventing sperm from getting to the eggs. Types include condoms; diaphragms; cervical caps; and contraceptive sponges.Keeping the woman's ovaries from releasing eggs that could be fertilized. Types include birth control pills; patches; shots; vaginal rings; and emergency contraceptive pills.IUDs; devices which are implanted into the uterus. They can be kept in place for several years.Sterilization; which permanently prevents a woman from getting pregnant or a man from being able to get a woman pregnant Your choice of birth control should depend on several factors. These include your health; frequency of sexual activity; number of sexual partners and desire to have children in the future. Your health care provider can help you select the best form of birth control for you.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Assisted Reproductive Technology,https://medlineplus.gov/assistedreproductivetechnology.html,Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is used to treat infertility. It includes fertility treatments that handle both a woman's egg and a man's sperm. It works by removing eggs from a woman's body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman's body. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most common and effective type of ART. ART procedures sometimes use donor eggs; donor sperm; or previously frozen embryos. It may also involve a surrogate or gestational carrier. A surrogate is a woman who becomes pregnant with sperm from the male partner of the couple. A gestational carrier becomes pregnant with an egg from the female partner and the sperm from the male partner. The most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. It can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are put into the woman's body.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/creutzfeldtjakobdisease.html,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare; degenerative brain disorder. Symptoms usually start around age 60. Memory problems; behavior changes; vision problems; and poor muscle coordination progress quickly to dementia; coma; and death. Most patients die within a year.The three main categories of CJD are  Sporadic CJD; which occurs for no known reason Hereditary CJD; which runs in familiesAcquired CJD; which occurs from contact with infected tissue; usually during a medical procedureCattle can get a disease related to CJD called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow disease."  There is concern that people can get a variant of CJD from eating beef from an infected animal; but there is no direct proof to support this.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Jaundice,https://medlineplus.gov/jaundice.html,Jaundice causes your skin and the whites of your eyes to turn yellow. Too much bilirubin causes jaundice.  Bilirubin is a yellow chemical in hemoglobin; the substance that carries oxygen in your red blood cells. As red blood cells break down; your body builds new cells to replace them. The old ones are processed by the liver. If the liver cannot handle the blood cells as they break down; bilirubin builds up in the body and your skin may look yellow. Many healthy babies have some jaundice during the first week of life.  It usually goes away.   However; jaundice can happen at any age and may be a sign of a problem.  Jaundice can happen for many reasons; such asBlood diseasesGenetic syndromesLiver diseases; such as hepatitis or cirrhosisBlockage of bile ducts Infections Medicines

Joint Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/jointdisorders.html,A joint is where two or more bones come together; like the knee; hip; elbow; or shoulder. Joints can be damaged by many types of injuries or diseases; includingArthritis - inflammation of a joint.  It causes pain; stiffness; and swelling. Over time; the joint can become severely damaged.Bursitis - inflammation of a fluid-filled sac that cushions the jointDislocations - injuries that force the ends of the bones out of positionTreatment of joint problems depends on the cause. If you have a sports injury; treatment often begins with the RICE (Rest; Ice; Compression; and Elevation) method to relieve pain; reduce swelling; and speed healing. Other possible treatments include pain relievers; keeping the injured area from moving; rehabilitation; and sometimes surgery. For arthritis; injuries; or other diseases; you may need joint replacement surgery to remove the damaged joint and put in a new one.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Juvenile Arthritis,https://medlineplus.gov/juvenilearthritis.html,Juvenile arthritis (JA) is arthritis that happens in children. It causes joint swelling; pain; stiffness; and loss of motion. It can affect any joint; but is more common in the knees; hands; and feet.

Kaposi's Sarcoma,https://medlineplus.gov/kaposissarcoma.html,Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a cancer that causes patches of abnormal tissue to grow under the skin; in the lining of the mouth; nose; and throat; in lymph nodes; or in other organs. These patches; or lesions; are usually red or purple. They are made of cancer cells; blood vessels; and blood cells.KS is caused by infection with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). Most people infected with HHV-8 don't get KS. It usually happens inPeople with weak immune systems; due to HIV/AIDS; drugs taken after an organ transplant; or another diseaseOlder men of Jewish or Mediterranean descentYoung men in AfricaThe skin lesions may not cause symptoms. But they can spread to other parts of the body; especially in people with HIV/AIDS. If they spread to the digestive tract or lungs; they can cause bleeding. Lesions on the lungs can also make it hard to breathe.Treatment depends on where the lesions are and how bad they are. Options include radiation therapy; surgery; chemotherapy; and biologic therapy. People with HIV/AIDS also take HIV/AIDS Medicines.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Kawasaki Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/kawasakidisease.html,Kawasaki disease is a rare childhood disease. It makes the walls of the blood vessels in the body become inflamed.

Kidney Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/kidneytests.html,You have two kidneys. They are fist-sized organs on either side of your backbone above your waist. Your kidneys filter and clean your blood; taking out waste products and making urine. Kidney tests check to see how well your kidneys are working. They include blood; urine; and imaging tests.Early kidney disease usually does not have signs or symptoms. Testing is the only way to know how your kidneys are doing. It is important for you to get checked for kidney disease if you have the key risk factors - diabetes; high blood pressure; heart disease; or a family history of kidney failure.Specific kidney tests includeGlomerular filtration rate (GFR) - one of the most common blood tests to check for chronic kidney disease. It tells how well your kidneys are filtering.Creatinine blood and urine tests - check the levels of creatinine; a waste product that your kidneys remove from your bloodAlbumin urine test - checks for albumin; a protein that can pass into the urine if the kidneys are damagedImaging tests; such as an ultrasound - provide pictures of the kidneys. The pictures help the health care provider see the size and shape of the kidneys; and check for anything unusual.Kidney biopsy - a procedure that involves taking a small piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. It checks for the cause of kidney disease and how damaged your kidneys are.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Kidney Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/kidneycancer.html,You have two kidneys. They are fist-sized organs on either side of your backbone above your waist. The tubes inside filter and clean your blood; taking out waste products and making urine.  Kidney cancer forms in the lining of tiny tubes inside your kidneys. Kidney cancer becomes more likely as you age. Risk factors include smoking; having certain genetic conditions; and misusing pain medicines for a long time.You may have no symptoms at first. They may appear as the cancer grows. See your health care provider if you noticeBlood in your urineA lump in your abdomenWeight loss for no reasonPain in your side that does not go awayLoss of appetiteTests to diagnose kidney cancer include blood; urine; and imaging tests. You may also have a biopsy.Treatment depends on your age; your overall health and how advanced the cancer is. It might include surgery; chemotherapy; or radiation; biologic; or targeted therapies.  Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Kidney Cysts,https://medlineplus.gov/kidneycysts.html, A cyst is a fluid-filled sac. You may get simple kidney cysts as you age; they are usually harmless. There are also some diseases which cause kidney cysts. One type is polycystic kidney disease (PKD). It runs in families. In PKD; many cysts grow in the kidneys. This can enlarge the kidneys and make them work poorly. About half of people with the most common type of PKD end up with kidney failure. PKD also causes cysts in other parts of the body; such as the liver. Often; there are no symptoms at first. Later; symptoms includePain in the back and lower sidesHeadachesBlood in the urineDoctors diagnose PKD with imaging tests and family history. There is no cure. Treatments can help with symptoms and complications. They include medicines and lifestyle changes; and if there is kidney failure; dialysis or kidney transplants.Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) happens in people who have chronic kidney disease; especially if they are on dialysis. Unlike PKD; the kidneys are normal sized; and cysts do not form in other parts of the body. ACKD often has no symptoms. Usually; the cysts are harmless and do not need treatment. If they do cause complications; treatments include medicines; draining the cysts; or surgery.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Kidney Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/kidneydiseases.html,You have two kidneys; each about the size of your fist. They are near the middle of your back; just below the rib cage. Inside each kidney there are about a million tiny structures called nephrons. They filter your blood. They remove wastes and extra water; which become urine.  The urine flows through tubes called ureters. It goes to your bladder; which stores the urine until you go to the bathroom.Most kidney diseases attack the nephrons. This damage may leave kidneys unable to remove wastes. Causes can include genetic problems; injuries; or medicines. You have a higher risk of kidney disease if you have diabetes; high blood pressure; or a close family member with kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease damages the nephrons slowly over several years. Other kidney problems includeCancerCystsStonesInfectionsYour doctor can do blood and urine tests to check if you have kidney disease. If your kidneys fail; you will need dialysis or a kidney transplant.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Kidney Failure,https://medlineplus.gov/kidneyfailure.html,Healthy kidneys clean your blood by removing excess fluid; minerals; and wastes. They also make hormones that keep your bones strong and your blood healthy. But if the kidneys are damaged; they don't work properly. Harmful wastes can build up in your body. Your blood pressure may rise. Your body may retain excess fluid and not make enough red blood cells. This is called kidney failure.If your kidneys fail; you need treatment to replace the work they normally do. The treatment options are dialysis or a kidney transplant. Each treatment has benefits and drawbacks. No matter which treatment you choose; you'll need to make some changes in your life; including how you eat and plan your activities. But with the help of health care providers; family; and friends; most people with kidney failure can lead full and active lives.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Kidney Transplantation,https://medlineplus.gov/kidneytransplantation.html,A kidney transplant is an operation that places a healthy kidney in your body. The transplanted kidney takes over the work of the two kidneys that failed; so you no longer need dialysis. During a transplant; the surgeon places the new kidney in your lower abdomen and connects the artery and vein of the new kidney to your artery and vein. Often; the new kidney will start making urine as soon as your blood starts flowing through it. But sometimes it takes a few weeks to start working. Many transplanted kidneys come from donors who have died. Some come from a living family member. The wait for a new kidney can be long.If you have a transplant; you must take drugs for the rest of your life; to keep your body from rejecting the new kidney.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Knee Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/kneeinjuriesanddisorders.html,Your knee joint is made up of bone; cartilage; ligaments and fluid. Muscles and tendons help the knee joint move. When any of these structures is hurt or diseased; you have knee problems. Knee problems can cause pain and difficulty walking.Knee problems are very common; and they occur in people of all ages. Knee problems can interfere with many things; from participation in sports to simply getting up from a chair and walking. This can have a big impact on your life.The most common disease affecting the knee is osteoarthritis. The cartilage in the knee gradually wears away; causing pain and swelling.Injuries to ligaments and tendons also cause knee problems. A common injury is to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). You usually injure your ACL by a sudden twisting motion. ACL and other knee injuries are common sports injuries.Treatment of knee problems depends on the cause. In some cases your doctor may recommend knee replacement.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Knee Replacement,https://medlineplus.gov/kneereplacement.html,Knee replacement is surgery for people with severe knee damage. Knee replacement can relieve pain and allow you to be more active. Your doctor may recommend it if you have knee pain and medicine and other treatments are not helping you anymore.When you have a total knee replacement; the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from the surface of your knee joint and replaces them with a man-made surface of metal and plastic. In a partial knee replacement; the surgeon only replaces one part of your knee joint.  The surgery can cause scarring; blood clots; and; rarely; infections. After a knee replacement; you will no longer be able to do certain activities; such as jogging and high-impact sports.
Spine Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/spineinjuriesanddisorders.html,Your backbone; or spine; is made up of 26 bone discs called vertebrae.

Preterm labor can start before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy.Labor happens in three stages. The first stage begins with contractions. It continues until your cervix has become thinner and dilated (stretched) to about 4 inches wide. The second stage is the active stage; in which you begin to push downward. Crowning is when your baby's scalp comes into view. Shortly afterward; your baby is born. In the third stage; you deliver the placenta. The placenta is the organ that supplied food and oxygen to your baby during pregnancy.Mothers and babies are monitored closely during labor. Most women are able to have a baby through normal vaginal delivery. If there are complications; the baby may need to be delivered surgically by a Cesarean section.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Laboratory Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/laboratorytests.html,Laboratory tests check a sample of your blood; urine; or body tissues. A technician or your doctor analyzes the test samples to see if your results fall within the normal range. The tests use a range because what is normal differs from person to person. Many factors affect test results. These includeYour sex; age and raceWhat you eat and drinkMedicines you takeHow well you followed pre-test instructionsYour doctor may also compare your results to results from previous tests. Laboratory tests are often part of a routine checkup to look for changes in your health. They also help doctors diagnose medical conditions; plan or evaluate treatments; and monitor diseases.

They range from saying sounds incorrectly to being completely unable to speak or understand speech.  Causes includeHearing disorders and deafnessVoice problems; such as dysphonia or those caused by cleft lip or palate Speech problems like stutteringDevelopmental disabilitiesLearning disordersAutism spectrum disorderBrain injuryStrokeSome speech and communication problems may be genetic. Often; no one knows the causes. By first grade; about 5 percent of children have noticeable speech disorders. Speech and language therapy can help. NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Speech and Language Problems in Children,https://medlineplus.gov/speechandlanguageproblemsinchildren.html,Children vary in their development of speech and language skills. Health care professionals have lists of milestones for what's normal. These milestones help figure out whether a child is on track or if he or she may need extra help.  For example; a child usually has one or two words like "Hi;" "dog;" "Dada;" or "Mama" by her first birthday.Sometimes a delay may be caused by hearing loss. Other times it may be due to a speech or language disorder. Children who have speech disorders may have trouble making speech sounds correctly. They may hesitate or stutter when talking.

Birth Weight,https://medlineplus.gov/birthweight.html,Birth weight is the first weight of your baby; taken just after he or she is born.  A low birth weight is less than 5.5 pounds.  A high birth weight is more than 8.8 pounds.A low birth weight baby can be born too small; too early (premature); or both. This can happen for many different reasons.  They include health problems in the mother; genetic factors; problems with the placenta and substance abuse by the mother.Some low birth weight babies may be more at risk for certain health problems. Some may become sick in the first days of life or develop infections. Others may suffer from longer-term problems such as delayed motor and social development or learning disabilities.High birth weight babies are often big because the parents are big; or the mother has diabetes during pregnancy.  These babies may be at a higher risk of birth injuries and problems with blood sugar.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Throat Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/throatcancer.html,Throat cancer is a type of head and neck cancer. Throat cancer has different names; depending on which part of the throat is affected. The different parts of your throat are called the oropharynx; the hypopharynx; the nasopharynx; and the larynx; or voice box.The main risk factors for throat cancer are using tobacco heavy drinking. Certain types of throat cancer also have other risk factors. For example; having HPV is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer.Symptoms of throat cancer may includeA sore throat that does not go awayA lump in the neckPain or ringing in the earsTrouble swallowingEar painTo diagnose throat cancers; doctors may do a physical exam and history; imaging tests; and a biopsy. You may also need other tests; depending on the type of cancer. Treatments include surgery; radiation therapy; and chemotherapy.

Throat Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/throatdisorders.html,Your throat is a tube that carries food to your esophagus and air to your windpipe and larynx. The technical name for your throat is the pharynx. Throat problems are common. You've probably had a sore throat. The cause is usually a viral infection; but other causes include allergies; infection with strep  bacteria or the leaking of stomach acids back up into the esophagus; called GERD. Other problems that affect the throat includeTonsillitis - inflammation of the tonsilsCancer Croup - inflammation; usually in small children; which causes a barking coughLaryngitis - swelling of the voice box; which can cause a hoarse voice or loss of voiceMost throat problems are minor and go away on their own. Treatments; when needed; depend on the problem.
Voice Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/voicedisorders.html,Voice is the sound made by air passing from your lungs through your larynx; or voice box. In your larynx are your vocal cords; two bands of muscle that vibrate to make sound. For most of us; our voices play a big part in who we are; what we do; and how we communicate. Like fingerprints; each person's voice is unique.Many things we do can injure our vocal cords. Talking too much; screaming; constantly clearing your throat; or smoking can make you hoarse. They can also lead to problems such as nodules; polyps; and sores on the vocal cords. Other causes of voice disorders include infections; upward movement of stomach acids into the throat; growths due to a virus; cancer; and diseases that paralyze the vocal cords.Signs that your voice isn't healthy includeYour voice has become hoarse or raspyYou've lost the ability to hit some high notes when singingYour voice suddenly sounds deeperYour throat often feels raw; achy; or strainedIt's become an effort to talkTreatment for voice disorders varies depending on the cause. Most voice problems can be successfully treated when diagnosed early.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders

Hemorrhagic Fevers,https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhagicfevers.html,Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of illnesses caused by four families of viruses. These include the Ebola and Marburg; Lassa fever; and yellow fever viruses. VHFs have common features: they affect many organs; they damage the blood vessels; and they affect the body's ability to regulate itself. Some VHFs cause mild disease; but some; like Ebola or Marburg; cause severe disease and death.VHFs are found around the world. Specific diseases are usually limited to areas where the animals that carry them live. For example; Lassa fever is limited to rural areas of West Africa where rats and mice carry the virus.The risk for travelers is low; but you should avoid visiting areas where there are disease outbreaks. Because there are no effective treatments for some of these viral infections; there is concern about their use in bioterrorism.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Latex Allergy,https://medlineplus.gov/latexallergy.html,Latex is a milky fluid that comes from the tropical rubber tree. Hundreds of everyday products contain latex. Repeated exposure to a protein in natural latex can make you more likely to develop a latex allergy. If your immune system detects the protein; a reaction can start in minutes. You could get a rash or asthma. In rare cases you could have a severe reaction called anaphylaxis.Your doctor may use a physical exam and skin and blood tests to diagnose it. There are medicines to treat a reaction; but it is best to try to avoid latex. Common latex products includeGlovesCondomsBalloonsRubber bandsShoe solesPacifiersYou can find latex-free versions of these products.

Amblyopia,https://medlineplus.gov/amblyopia.html, Amblyopia; or "lazy eye;" is the most common cause of visual impairment in children.  It happens when an eye fails to work properly with the brain.  The eye may look normal; but the brain favors the other eye.   In some cases; it can affect both eyes.  Causes includeStrabismus - a disorder in which the two eyes don't line up in the same directionRefractive error in an eye - when one eye cannot focus as well as the other; because of a problem with its shape.  This includes nearsightedness; farsightedness; and astigmatism.Cataract - a clouding in the lens of the eyeIt can be hard to diagnose amblyopia.  It is often found during a routine vision exam.Treatment for amblyopia forces the child to use the eye with weaker vision.  There are two common ways to do this.  One is to have the child wear a patch over the good eye for several hours each day; over a number of weeks to months.  The other is with eye drops that temporarily blur vision.  Each day; the child gets a drop of a drug called atropine in the stronger eye.  It is also sometimes necessary to treat the underlying cause.  This could include glasses or surgery.NIH: National Eye Institute
Cholesterol,https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterol.html,Cholesterol is a waxy; fat-like substance that occurs naturally in all parts of the body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much in your blood; it can combine with other substances in the blood and stick to the walls of your arteries. This is called plaque. Plaque can narrow your arteries or even block them.High levels of cholesterol in the blood can increase your risk of heart disease. Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older. There are usually no signs or symptoms that you have high blood cholesterol; but it can be detected with a blood test. You are likely to have high cholesterol if members of your family have it; if you are overweight or if you eat a lot of fatty foods.You can lower your cholesterol by exercising more and eating more fruits and vegetables. You also may need to take medicine to lower your cholesterol.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Lead Poisoning,https://medlineplus.gov/leadpoisoning.html,Lead is a metal that occurs naturally in the earth's crust.  Lead can be found in all parts of our environment. Much of it comes from human activities such as mining and manufacturing. Lead used to be in paint; older houses may still have lead paint. You could be exposed to lead byEating food or drinking water that contains lead. Water pipes in older homes may contain lead.Working in a job where lead is usedUsing lead in a hobby; such as making stained glass or lead-glazed potteryUsing folk remedies such as herbs or foods that contain leadBreathing air; drinking water; eating food; or swallowing or touching dirt that contains lead can cause many health problems. Lead can affect almost every organ and system in your body. In adults; lead can increase blood pressure and cause infertility; nerve disorders; and muscle and joint pain. It can also make you irritable and affect your ability to concentrate and remember.Lead is especially dangerous for children. A child who swallows large amounts of lead may develop anemia; severe stomachache; muscle weakness; and brain damage. Even at low levels; lead can affect a child's mental and physical growth.Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry
Learning Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/learningdisorders.html,Learning disorders affect how a person understands; remembers and responds to new information. People with learning disorders may have problems  Listening or paying attention Speaking Reading  or writing Doing math  Although learning disorders occur in very young children; they are usually not recognized until the child reaches school age. About one-third of children who have learning disabilities also have ADHD; which makes it hard to focus.  Evaluation and testing by a trained professional can help identify a learning disorder. The next step is special education; which involves helping your child in the areas where he or she needs the most help. Sometimes tutors or speech or language therapists also work with the children.  Learning disorders do not go away; but strategies to work around them can make them less of a problem. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

Osteonecrosis,https://medlineplus.gov/osteonecrosis.html,Osteonecrosis is a disease caused by reduced blood flow to bones in the joints. In people with healthy bones; new bone is always replacing old bone. In osteonecrosis; the lack of blood causes the bone to break down faster than the body can make enough new bone. The bone starts to die and may break down.You can have osteonecrosis in one or several bones. It is most common in the upper leg. Other common sites are your upper arm and your knees; shoulders and ankles. The disease can affect men and women of any age; but it usually strikes in your thirties; forties or fifties. At first; you might not have any symptoms. As the disease gets worse; you will probably have joint pain that becomes more severe. You may not be able to bend or move the affected joint very well. No one is sure what causes the disease. Risk factors include Long-term steroid treatmentAlcohol abuseJoint injuriesHaving certain diseases; including arthritis and cancer  Doctors use imaging tests and other tests to diagnose osteonecrosis. Treatments include medicines; using crutches; limiting activities that put weight on the affected joints; electrical stimulation and surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Legionnaires' Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/legionnairesdisease.html,Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by bacteria.

Leishmaniasis,https://medlineplus.gov/leishmaniasis.html,Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease spread by the bite of infected sand flies. There are several different forms of leishmaniasis. The most common are cutaneous and visceral.  The cutaneous type causes skin sores. The visceral type affects internal organs such as the spleen; liver; and bone marrow. People with this form usually have fever; weight loss; and an enlarged spleen and liver. Leishmaniasis is found in parts of about 88 countries. Most of these countries are in the tropics and subtropics. It is possible but very unlikely that you would get this disease in the United States. But you should be aware of it if you are traveling to the Middle East or parts of Central America; South America; Asia; Africa or southern Europe.  Treatment is with medicines that contain antimony; a type of metal; or with strong antibiotics. The best way to prevent the disease is to protect yourself from sand fly bites:Stay indoors from dusk to dawn; when sand flies are the most activeWear long pants and long-sleeved shirts when outsideUse insect repellent and bed nets as neededCenters for Disease Control and Prevention
Mycobacterial Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/mycobacterialinfections.html,Mycobacteria are a type of germ. There are many different kinds. The most common one causes tuberculosis. Another one causes leprosy. Still others cause infections that are called atypical mycobacterial infections.  They aren't "typical" because they don't cause tuberculosis. But they can still harm people; especially people with other problems that affect their immunity; such as AIDS. Sometimes you can have these infections with no symptoms at all. At other times; they can cause lung symptoms similar to tuberculosis:  Cough Weight loss Coughing up blood or mucus Weakness or fatigue Fever and chills Night sweats Lack of appetite and weight loss  Medicines can treat these infections; but often more than one is needed to cure the infection.

Leukodystrophies,https://medlineplus.gov/leukodystrophies.html,The leukodystrophies are rare diseases that affect the cells of the brain. Specifically; the diseases affect the myelin sheath; the material that surrounds and protects nerve cells. Damage to this sheath slows down or blocks messages between the brain and the rest of the body. This leads to problems with  Movement Speaking Vision Hearing  Mental and physical development   Most of the leukodystrophies are genetic. They usually appear during infancy or childhood. They can be hard to detect early because children seem healthy at first. However; symptoms gradually get worse over time.   There are no cures for any of the leukodystrophies. Medicines; speech therapy and physical therapy might help with symptoms. Researchers are testing bone marrow transplantation as a treatment for some of the leukodystrophies.

Critical care usually takes place in an intensive care unit (ICU) or trauma center.Monitors; intravenous (IV) tubes; feeding tubes; catheters; breathing machines; and other equipment are common in critical care units.  They can keep a person alive; but can also increase the risk of infection.Many patients in critical care recover; but some die. Having advance directives in place is important. They help health care providers and family members make end-of-life decisions if you are not able to make them.
Sprains and Strains,https://medlineplus.gov/sprainsandstrains.html,A sprain is a stretched or torn ligament. Ligaments are tissues that connect bones at a joint. Falling; twisting; or getting hit can all cause a sprain. Ankle and wrist sprains are common. Symptoms include pain; swelling; bruising; and being unable to move your joint. You might feel a pop or tear when the injury happens. A strain is a stretched or torn muscle or tendon. Tendons are tissues that connect muscle to bone. Twisting or pulling these tissues can cause a strain. Strains can happen suddenly or develop over time. Back and hamstring muscle strains are common. Many people get strains playing sports. Symptoms include pain; muscle spasms; swelling; and trouble moving the muscle. At first; treatment of both sprains and strains usually involves resting the injured area; icing it; wearing a bandage or device that compresses the area; and medicines. Later treatment might include exercise and physical therapy. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases

Lipid Metabolism Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/lipidmetabolismdisorders.html,Metabolism is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Food is made up of proteins; carbohydrates; and fats. Chemicals in your digestive system (enzymes) break the food parts down into sugars and acids; your body's fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away; or it can store the energy in your body tissues. If you have a metabolic disorder; something goes wrong with this process.Lipid metabolism disorders; such as Gaucher disease and Tay-Sachs disease; involve lipids. Lipids are fats or fat-like substances. They include oils; fatty acids; waxes; and cholesterol. If you have one of these disorders; you may not have enough enzymes to break down lipids. Or the enzymes may not work properly and your body can't convert the fats into energy. They cause a harmful amount of lipids to build up in your body. Over time; that can damage your cells and tissues; especially in the brain; peripheral nervous system; liver; spleen; and bone marrow. Many of these disorders can be very serious; or sometimes even fatal.These disorders are inherited. Newborn babies get screened for some of them; using blood tests. If there is a family history of one of these disorders; parents can get genetic testing to see whether they carry the gene. Other genetic tests can tell whether the fetus has the disorder or carries the gene for the disorder.Enzyme replacement therapies can help with a few of these disorders. For others; there is no treatment. Medicines; blood transfusions; and other procedures may help with complications.
Listeria Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/listeriainfections.html,Listeriosis is a foodborne illness caused by Listeria monocytogenes; bacteria found in soil and water.  It can be in a variety of raw foods as well as in processed foods and foods made from unpasteurized milk. Listeria is unlike many other germs because it can grow even in the cold temperature of the refrigerator.  Symptoms include fever and chills; headache; upset stomach and vomiting. Treatment is with antibiotics.Anyone can get the illness. But it is most likely to affect pregnant women and unborn babies; older adults; and people with weak immune systems. To reduce your riskUse precooked and ready-to-eat foods as soon as you can Avoid raw milk and raw milk productsHeat ready-to-eat foods and leftovers until they are steaming hotWash fresh fruits and vegetables Avoid rare meat and refrigerated smoked seafoodCenters for Disease Control and Prevention
Liver Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/livercancer.html,Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons. Primary liver cancer starts in the liver.  Metastatic liver cancer starts somewhere else and spreads to your liver. Risk factors for primary liver cancer include Having hepatitis B or CHeavy alcohol useHaving cirrhosis; or scarring of the liverHaving hemochromatosis; an iron storage diseaseObesity and diabetesSymptoms can include a lump or pain on the right side of your abdomen and yellowing of the skin. However; you may not have symptoms until the cancer is advanced.  This makes it harder to treat. Doctors use tests that examine the liver and the blood to diagnose liver cancer. Treatment options include surgery; radiation; chemotherapy; or liver transplantation. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Cirrhosis,https://medlineplus.gov/cirrhosis.html,Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver. Scar tissue forms because of injury or long-term disease. Scar tissue cannot do what healthy liver tissue does - make protein; help fight infections; clean the blood; help digest food and store energy.   Cirrhosis can lead to  Easy bruising or bleeding; or nosebleedsSwelling of the abdomen or legs Extra sensitivity to medicinesHigh blood pressure in the vein entering the liverEnlarged veins called varices in the esophagus and stomach. Varices can bleed suddenly. Kidney failureJaundiceSevere itchingGallstonesA small number of people with cirrhosis get liver cancer.Your doctor will diagnose cirrhosis with blood tests; imaging tests; or a biopsy.Cirrhosis has many causes. In the United States; the most common causes are chronic alcoholism and hepatitis. Nothing will make the scar tissue disappear; but treating the cause can keep it from getting worse. If too much scar tissue forms; you may need to consider a liver transplant.  NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Liver Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html,Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons.There are many kinds of liver diseases:Diseases caused by  viruses; such as hepatitis A; hepatitis B; and hepatitis CDiseases caused by drugs; poisons; or too much alcohol. Examples include fatty liver disease and cirrhosis.Liver cancerInherited diseases; such as hemochromatosis and Wilson diseaseSymptoms of liver disease can vary; but they often include swelling of the abdomen and legs; bruising easily; changes in the color of your stool and urine; and jaundice; or yellowing of the skin and eyes. Sometimes there are no symptoms. Tests such as imaging tests and liver function tests can check for liver damage and help to diagnose liver diseases.
Liver Function Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/liverfunctiontests.html,Your liver helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons.  Liver function tests are blood tests that check to see how well your liver is working. They check for liver damage; and can help diagnose liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. You may have liver function tests as part of a regular checkup. Or you may have them if you have symptoms of liver disease. Doctors also use the tests to monitor some liver diseases; treatments; and possible side effects of medicines.Liver function tests measure certain proteins; enzymes; and substances; including:Albumin; a protein that the liver makesTotal protein (TP)Enzymes that are found in the liver; including alanine transaminase (ALT); aspartate transaminase (AST); alkaline phosphatase (ALP); and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)Bilirubin; a yellow substance that is part of bile. It is formed when your red blood cells break down. Too much bilirubin in the blood can cause jaundice. There is also a urine test for bilirubin.Prothrombin time; which measures how long it takes for your blood to clot. Prothrombin is made by the liver.
Skin Aging,https://medlineplus.gov/skinaging.html,Your skin changes as you age. You might notice wrinkles; age spots and dryness. Your skin also becomes thinner and loses fat; making it less plump and smooth. It might take longer to heal; too.  Sunlight is a major cause of skin aging. You can protect yourself by staying out of the sun when it is strongest; using sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher; wearing protective clothing; and avoiding sunlamps and tanning beds. Cigarette smoking also contributes to wrinkles. The wrinkling increases with the amount of cigarettes and number of years a person has smoked. Many products claim to revitalize aging skin or reduce wrinkles; but the Food and Drug Administration has approved only a few for sun-damaged or aging skin. Various treatments soothe dry skin and reduce the appearance of age spots. NIH: National Institute on Aging
Liver Transplantation,https://medlineplus.gov/livertransplantation.html,Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons. You cannot live without a liver that works. If your liver fails; your doctor may put you on a waiting list for a liver transplant. Doctors do liver transplants when other treatment cannot keep a damaged liver working.During a liver transplantation; the surgeon removes the diseased liver and replaces it with a healthy one. Most transplant livers come from a donor who has died.  Sometimes there is a living donor.  This is when a healthy person donates part of his or her liver for a specific patient.The most common reason for a transplant in adults is cirrhosis. This is scarring of the liver; caused by injury or long-term disease. The most common reason in children is biliary atresia; a disease of the bile ducts.If you have a transplant; you must take drugs the rest of your life to help keep your body from rejecting the new liver.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Advance Directives,https://medlineplus.gov/advancedirectives.html,What kind of medical care would you want if you were too ill or hurt to express your wishes? Advance directives are legal documents that allow you to spell out your decisions about end-of-life care ahead of time. They give you a way to tell your wishes to family; friends; and health care professionals and to avoid confusion later on. A living will tells which treatments you want if you are dying or permanently unconscious. You can accept or refuse medical care. You might want to include instructions onThe use of dialysis and breathing machinesIf you want to be resuscitated if your breathing or heartbeat stops Tube feedingOrgan or tissue donation A durable power of attorney for health care is a document that names your health care proxy. Your proxy is someone you trust to make health decisions for you if you are unable to do so. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Cancer--Living with Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/cancerlivingwithcancer.html,Cancer is common. Half of all men and a third of women will get a diagnosis of cancer in their lifetime. Many people with cancer do survive. Millions of Americans alive today have a history of cancer.For most people with cancer; living with the disease is the biggest challenge they have ever faced. It can change your routines; roles and relationships. It can cause money and work problems. The treatment can change the way you feel and look. Learning more about ways you can help yourself may ease some of your concerns.  Support from others is important.All cancer survivors should have follow-up care. Knowing what to expect after cancer treatment can help you and your family make plans; lifestyle changes; and important decisions.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Living with HIV/AIDS,https://medlineplus.gov/livingwithhivaids.html,HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.Infection with HIV is serious. But thanks to better treatments; people with HIV/AIDS are now living longer; and have a better quality of life. If you have HIV; you can help yourself byGetting medical care as soon as you find out that you have HIVFinding a health care provider has experience in treating HIV/AIDSIf are on any medicines; make sure to take them regularlyGetting support; such as from support groups; therapists; and social service organizationsLearning as much as you can about HIV/AIDS and its treatmentTrying to live a healthy lifestyle; including eating healthy foods; exercising regularly; and getting enough sleepIt is also important to reduce the risk of spreading HIV to other people. You should tell your sex partners that you have HIV; and always use condoms.
Tetanus,https://medlineplus.gov/tetanus.html,Tetanus is a serious illness caused by Clostridium bacteria. The bacteria live in soil; saliva; dust; and manure. The bacteria can enter the body through a deep cut; like those you might get from stepping on a nail; or through a burn.The infection causes painful tightening of the muscles; usually all over the body. It can lead to "locking" of the jaw. This makes it impossible to open your mouth or swallow. Tetanus is a medical emergency. You need to get treatment in a hospital.A vaccine can prevent tetanus.  It is given as a part of routine childhood immunization. Adults should get a tetanus shot; or booster; every 10 years. If you get a bad cut or burn; see your doctor - you may need a booster. Immediate and proper wound care can prevent tetanus infection.
Assisted Living,https://medlineplus.gov/assistedliving.html,Assisted living is for adults who need help with everyday tasks. They may need help with dressing; bathing; eating; or using the bathroom; but they don't need full-time nursing care. Some assisted living facilities are part of retirement communities. Others are near nursing homes; so a person can move easily if needs change.Assisted living costs less than nursing home care. It is still fairly expensive. Older people or their families usually pay for it. Health and long-term care insurance policies may cover some of the costs. Medicare does not cover the costs of assisted living. Administration on Aging
Nursing Homes,https://medlineplus.gov/nursinghomes.html,A nursing home is a place for people who don't need to be in a hospital but can't be cared for at home. Most nursing homes have nursing aides and skilled nurses on hand 24 hours a day.  Some nursing homes are set up like a hospital. The staff provides medical care; as well as physical; speech and occupational therapy. There might be a nurses' station on each floor. Other nursing homes try to be more like home. They try to have a neighborhood feel. Often; they don't have a fixed day-to-day schedule; and kitchens might be open to residents. Staff members are encouraged to develop relationships with residents. Some nursing homes have special care units for people with serious memory problems such as Alzheimer's disease. Some will let couples live together. Nursing homes are not only for the elderly; but for anyone who requires 24-hour care. NIH: National Institute on Aging
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,https://medlineplus.gov/amyotrophiclateralsclerosis.html,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a nervous system disease that attacks nerve cells called neurons in your brain and spinal cord. These neurons transmit messages from your brain and spinal cord to your voluntary muscles - the ones you can control; like in your arms and legs. At first; this causes mild muscle problems. Some people noticeTrouble walking or running Trouble writing Speech problemsEventually; you lose your strength and cannot move. When muscles in your chest fail; you cannot breathe. A breathing machine can help; but most people with ALS die from respiratory failure. The disease usually strikes between age 40 and 60. More men than women get it. No one knows what causes ALS. It can run in families; but usually it strikes at random. There is no cure. Medicines can relieve symptoms and; sometimes; prolong survival. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Back Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/backpain.html,If you've ever groaned; "Oh; my aching back!"; you are not alone. Back pain is one of the most common medical problems; affecting 8 out of 10 people at some point during their lives. Back pain can range from a dull; constant ache to a sudden; sharp pain. Acute back pain comes on suddenly and usually lasts from a few days to a few weeks. Back pain is called chronic if it lasts for more than three months.Most back pain goes away on its own; though it may take awhile. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers and resting can help. However; staying in bed for more than 1 or 2 days can make it worse. If your back pain is severe or doesn't improve after three days; you should call your health care provider.  You should also get medical attention if you have back pain following an injury.Treatment for back pain depends on what kind of pain you have; and what is causing it. It may include hot or cold packs; exercise; medicines; injections; complementary treatments; and sometimes surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Birth Weight,https://medlineplus.gov/birthweight.html,Birth weight is the first weight of your baby; taken just after he or she is born.  A low birth weight is less than 5.5 pounds.  A high birth weight is more than 8.8 pounds.A low birth weight baby can be born too small; too early (premature); or both. This can happen for many different reasons.  They include health problems in the mother; genetic factors; problems with the placenta and substance abuse by the mother.Some low birth weight babies may be more at risk for certain health problems. Some may become sick in the first days of life or develop infections. Others may suffer from longer-term problems such as delayed motor and social development or learning disabilities.High birth weight babies are often big because the parents are big; or the mother has diabetes during pregnancy.  These babies may be at a higher risk of birth injuries and problems with blood sugar.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Low Blood Pressure,https://medlineplus.gov/lowbloodpressure.html,You've probably heard that high blood pressure is a problem. Sometimes blood pressure that is too low can also cause problems.Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats; it pumps out blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats; pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest; between beats; your blood pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually they're written one above or before the other; such as 120/80. If your blood pressure reading is 90/60 or lower; you have low blood pressure. Some people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no symptoms and their low readings are normal for them. In other people; blood pressure drops below normal because of a medical condition or certain medicines. Some people may have symptoms of low blood pressure when standing up too quickly.  Low blood pressure is a problem only if it causes dizziness; fainting or in extreme cases; shock. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Hypoglycemia,https://medlineplus.gov/hypoglycemia.html,Hypoglycemia means low blood glucose; or blood sugar. Your body needs glucose to have enough energy. After you eat; your blood absorbs glucose. If you eat more sugar than your body needs; your muscles; and liver store the extra. When your blood sugar begins to fall; a hormone tells your liver to release glucose.In most people; this raises blood sugar. If it doesn't; you have hypoglycemia; and your blood sugar can be dangerously low. Signs include HungerShakinessDizzinessConfusionDifficulty speakingFeeling anxious or weakIn people with diabetes; hypoglycemia is often a side effect of diabetes medicines. Eating or drinking something with carbohydrates can help. If it happens often; your health care provider may need to change your treatment plan.You can also have low blood sugar without having diabetes.  Causes include certain medicines or diseases; hormone or enzyme deficiencies; and tumors. Laboratory tests can help find the cause. The kind of treatment depends on why you have low blood sugar.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Male Infertility,https://medlineplus.gov/maleinfertility.html,Infertility is a term doctors use if a man hasn't been able to get a woman pregnant after at least one year of trying. Causes of male infertility includePhysical problems with the testiclesBlockages in the ducts that carry spermHormone problemsA history of high fevers or mumpsGenetic disordersLifestyle or environmental factorsAbout a third of the time; infertility is because of a problem with the man. One third of the time; it is a problem with the woman. Sometimes no cause can be found.If you suspect you are infertile; see your doctor. There are tests that may tell if you have fertility problems. When it is possible to find the cause; treatments may include medicines; surgery; or assisted reproductive technology. Happily; many couples treated for infertility are able to have babies.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Vision Impairment and Blindness,https://medlineplus.gov/visionimpairmentandblindness.html,If you have low vision; eyeglasses; contact lenses; medicine; or surgery may not help. Activities like reading; shopping; cooking; writing; and watching TV may be hard to do.   The leading causes of low vision and blindness in the United States are age-related eye diseases: macular degeneration; cataract and glaucoma.  Other eye disorders; eye injuries; and birth defects can also cause vision loss. Whatever the cause; lost vision cannot be restored. It can; however; be managed. A loss of vision means that you may have to reorganize your life and learn new ways of doing things. If you have some vision; visual aids such as special glasses and large print books can make life easier. There are also devices to help those with no vision; like text-reading software and braille books.The sooner vision loss or eye disease is found and treated; the greater your chances of keeping your remaining vision. You should have regular comprehensive eye exams by an eye care professional.NIH: National Eye Institute
Laser Eye Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/lasereyesurgery.html,For many people; laser eye surgery can correct their vision so they no longer need glasses or contact lenses.  Laser eye surgery reshapes the cornea; the clear front part of the eye.  This changes its focusing power. There are different types of laser eye surgery.  LASIK - laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis - is one of the most common. Many patients who have LASIK end up with 20/20 vision. But; like all medical procedures; it has both risks and benefits.  Only your eye doctor can tell if you are a good candidate for laser eye surgery.

Mastectomy,https://medlineplus.gov/mastectomy.html,A mastectomy is surgery to remove a breast or part of a breast. It is usually done to treat breast cancer.  Types of breast surgery includeTotal (simple) mastectomy - removal of breast tissue and nippleModified radical mastectomy - removal of the breast; most of the lymph nodes under the arm; and often the lining over the chest musclesLumpectomy - surgery to remove the tumor and a small amount of normal tissue around itWhich surgery you have depends on the stage of cancer; size of the tumor; size of the breast; and whether the lymph nodes are involved. Many women have breast reconstruction to rebuild the breast after a mastectomy.Sometimes mastectomy is done to prevent breast cancer. Only high-risk patients have this type of surgery.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Lung Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/lungcancer.html,Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. It is a leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States. Cigarette smoking causes most lung cancers. The more cigarettes you smoke per day and the earlier you started smoking; the greater your risk of lung cancer. High levels of pollution; radiation and asbestos exposure may also increase risk. Common symptoms of lung cancer includeA cough that doesn't go away and gets worse over timeConstant chest painCoughing up bloodShortness of breath; wheezing; or hoarsenessRepeated problems with pneumonia or bronchitisSwelling of the neck and faceLoss of appetite or weight lossFatigueDoctors diagnose lung cancer using a physical exam; imaging; and lab tests. Treatment depends on the type; stage; and how advanced it is. Treatments include surgery; chemotherapy; radiation therapy; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Lung Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/lungdiseases.html,When you breathe; your lungs take in oxygen from the air and deliver it to the bloodstream. The cells in your body need oxygen to work and grow.  During a normal day; you breathe nearly 25;000 times. People with lung disease have difficulty breathing. Millions of people in the U.S. have lung disease. If all types of lung disease are lumped together; it is the number three killer in the United States.The term lung disease refers to many disorders affecting the lungs; such as asthma; COPD; infections like influenza; pneumonia and tuberculosis; lung cancer; and many other breathing problems. Some lung diseases can lead to respiratory failure.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Pulmonary Rehabilitation,https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryrehabilitation.html,Pulmonary rehabilitation (rehab) is a medically supervised program to help people who have chronic breathing problems; including  COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Sarcoidosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Cystic fibrosis  During pulmonary rehab you may do exercise training and learn breathing techniques. You'll also get tips on conserving your energy and advice on nutrition and coping. These can't cure your lung disease or completely ease your breathing problems. But it can help you function better in your daily life. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Lung Transplantation,https://medlineplus.gov/lungtransplantation.html,A lung transplant removes a person's diseased lung and replaces it with a healthy one.  The healthy lung comes from a donor who has died. Some people get one lung during a transplant. Other people get two.Lung transplants are used for people who are likely to die from lung disease within 1 to 2 years. Their conditions are so severe that other treatments; such as medicines or breathing devices; no longer work. Lung transplants most often are used to treat people who have severeCOPD Cystic fibrosisIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosisAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiencyPulmonary hypertension Complications of lung transplantation include rejection of the transplanted lung and infection. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Lupus,https://medlineplus.gov/lupus.html,What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body; including the joints; skin; kidneys; heart; lungs; blood vessels; and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe; and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus; which is rare; affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.Who gets lupus?Anyone can get lupus; but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in Caucasian women. It's also more common in Hispanic; Asian; and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is not known.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms; and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes; most often on the face (also called the "butterfly rash")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms; it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.How do I know if I have lupus?There is no single test to diagnose lupus; and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:Medical historyComplete examBlood testsSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)What are the treatments for lupus?There is no cure for lupus; but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example; if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels; you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.The goals of the treatment plan are toPrevent flaresTreat flares when they occurReduce organ damage and other problemsTreatments may include drugs toReduce swelling and painPrevent or reduce flaresHelp the immune systemReduce or prevent damage to jointsBalance the hormonesBesides taking medicines for lupus; you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol; high blood pressure; or infection.Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time; no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.How can I cope with lupus?It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Lyme Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/lymedisease.html,Lyme disease is a bacterial infection you get from the bite of an infected tick. The first symptom is usually a red rash; which may look like a bull's eye. But not all people with Lyme disease have a rash. As the infection spreads to other parts of the body; you may have A feverA headacheBody achesA stiff neckFatigueLyme disease can be hard to diagnose because many of its symptoms are like those of the flu and other diseases. And you may not have noticed a tick bite. Your health care provider will look at your symptoms and medical history to figure out whether you have Lyme disease. Lab tests may not always give a clear answer until you have been infected for at least a few weeks.Antibiotics can cure most cases of Lyme disease. The sooner treatment begins; the quicker and more complete the recovery.After treatment; some patients may still have muscle or joint aches and nervous system symptoms. This is called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Long-term antibiotics have not been shown to help with PTLDS. However; there are ways to help with the symptoms of PTLDS; and most patients do get better with time.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Lymphatic Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/lymphaticdiseases.html,The lymphatic system is a network of tissues and organs. It is made up ofLymph - a fluid that contains white blood cells that defend against germsLymph vessels - vessels that carry lymph throughout your body.  They are different from blood vessels.Lymph nodes - glands found throughout the lymph vessels. Along with your spleen; these nodes are where white blood cells fight infection.Your bone marrow and thymus produce the cells in lymph. They are part of the system; too.The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps your body fluids in balance. If it's not working properly; fluid builds in your tissues and causes swelling; called lymphedema. Other lymphatic system problems can include infections; blockage; and cancer.

Lymphoma,https://medlineplus.gov/lymphoma.html,Lymphoma is a cancer of a part of the immune system called the lymph system.  There are many types of lymphoma.  One type is Hodgkin disease.  The rest are called non-Hodgkin lymphomas.Non-Hodgkin lymphomas begin when a type of white blood cell; called a T cell or B cell; becomes abnormal. The cell divides again and again; making more and more abnormal cells. These abnormal cells can spread to almost any other part of the body. Most of the time; doctors don't know why a person gets non-Hodgkin lymphoma. You are at increased risk if you have a weakened immune system or have certain types of infections.Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can cause many symptoms; such as Swollen; painless lymph nodes in the neck; armpits or groinUnexplained weight loss Fever Soaking night sweats Coughing; trouble breathing or chest pain Weakness and tiredness that don't go away Pain; swelling or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen Your doctor will diagnose lymphoma with a physical exam; blood tests; a chest x-ray; and a biopsy.  Treatments include chemotherapy; radiation therapy; targeted therapy; biological therapy; or therapy to remove proteins from the blood. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.  Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer. If you don't have symptoms; you may not need treatment right away. This is called watchful waiting.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Macular Degeneration,https://medlineplus.gov/maculardegeneration.html,Macular degeneration; or age-related macular degeneration (AMD); is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. It is a disease that destroys your sharp; central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving. AMD affects the macula; the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt; but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked.Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision.NIH: National Eye Institute
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/creutzfeldtjakobdisease.html,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare; degenerative brain disorder. Symptoms usually start around age 60. Memory problems; behavior changes; vision problems; and poor muscle coordination progress quickly to dementia; coma; and death. Most patients die within a year.The three main categories of CJD are  Sporadic CJD; which occurs for no known reason Hereditary CJD; which runs in familiesAcquired CJD; which occurs from contact with infected tissue; usually during a medical procedureCattle can get a disease related to CJD called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow disease."  There is concern that people can get a variant of CJD from eating beef from an infected animal; but there is no direct proof to support this.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Minerals,https://medlineplus.gov/minerals.html,Minerals are important for your body to stay healthy. Your body uses minerals for many different jobs; including keeping your bones; muscles; heart; and brain working properly. Minerals are also important for making enzymes and hormones.There are two kinds of minerals: macrominerals and trace minerals. You need larger amounts of macrominerals. They include calcium; phosphorus; magnesium; sodium; potassium; chloride and sulfur. You only need small amounts of trace minerals. They include iron; manganese; copper; iodine; zinc; cobalt; fluoride and selenium. Most people get the amount of minerals they need by eating a wide variety of foods. In some cases; your doctor may recommend a mineral supplement. People who have certain health problems or take some medicines may need to get less of one of the minerals. For example; people with chronic kidney disease need to limit foods that are high in potassium.
MRI Scans,https://medlineplus.gov/mriscans.html,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a large magnet and radio waves to look at organs and structures inside your body. Health care professionals use MRI scans to diagnose a variety of conditions; from torn ligaments to tumors. MRIs are very useful for examining the brain and spinal cord. During the scan; you lie on a table that slides inside a tunnel-shaped machine. Doing the scan can take a long time; and you must stay still. The scan is painless. The MRI machine makes a lot of noise. The technician may offer you earplugs.Before you get a scan; tell your doctor if you Are pregnant Have pieces of metal in your body. You might have metal in your body if you have a shrapnel or bullet injury or if you are a welder.Have metal or electronic devices in your body; such as a cardiac pacemaker or a metal artificial joint

They includeHair dyes Makeup Perfumes Skin-care creams Cosmetics that treat or prevent diseases are also drugs. Products such as dandruff shampoo; fluoride toothpaste; and antiperspirant deodorant are both cosmetics and drugs. A good way to tell if you're buying a cosmetic that is also a drug is to see if the first ingredient listed is an "active ingredient." The active ingredient is the chemical that makes the product effective. The manufacturer must have proof that it's safe for its intended use.Cosmetics can cause allergic reactions. The first sign is often red and irritated skin. Fragrances and preservatives are the most common causes of skin problems.To find out all the ingredients in a cosmetic you use; check the container. Manufacturers are required to list them. Labels such as "natural" and "hypoallergenic" have no official meaning. Companies can use them to mean whatever they want. Food and Drug Administration

If you have a malabsorption syndrome; your small intestine cannot absorb nutrients from foods.Causes of malabsorption syndromes includeCeliac diseaseLactose intoleranceShort bowel syndrome. This happens after surgery to remove half or more of the small intestine. You might need the surgery if you have a problem with the small intestine from a disease; injury; or birth defect.Whipple disease; a rare bacterial infectionGenetic diseasesCertain medicinesSymptoms of different malabsorption syndromes can vary.  They often include chronic diarrhea; abnormal stools; weight loss; and gas. Your doctor may use lab; imaging; or other tests to make a diagnosis.Treatment of malabsorption syndromes depends on the cause.
Malaria,https://medlineplus.gov/malaria.html,Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite. You get it when an infected mosquito bites you. Malaria is a major cause of death worldwide; but it is almost wiped out in the United States. The disease is mostly a problem in developing countries with warm climates. If you travel to these countries; you are at risk. There are four different types of malaria caused by four related parasites. The most deadly type occurs in Africa south of the Sahara Desert.Malaria symptoms include chills; flu-like symptoms; fever; vomiting; diarrhea; and jaundice. A blood test can diagnose it. It can be life-threatening. However; you can treat malaria with drugs. The type of drug depends on which kind of malaria you have and where you were infected.Malaria can be prevented. When traveling to areas where malaria is foundSee your doctor for medicines that protect you Wear insect repellent with DEET Cover upSleep under mosquito netting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Male Breast Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/malebreastcancer.html,Although breast cancer is much more common in women; men can get it too. It happens most often to men between the ages of 60 and 70.Breast lumps usually aren't cancer. However; most men with breast cancer have lumps. Other breast symptoms can includeDimpled or puckered skinA red; scaly nipple or skinFluid dischargeRisk factors for male breast cancer include exposure to radiation; a family history of breast cancer; and having high estrogen levels; which can happen with diseases like cirrhosis or Klinefelter's syndrome.Treatment for male breast cancer is usually a mastectomy; which is surgery to remove the breast. Other treatments include radiation; chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Penis Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/penisdisorders.html,Problems with the penis can cause pain and affect a man's sexual function and fertility. Penis disorders include   Erectile dysfunction - inability to get or keep an erection  Priapism - a painful erection that does not go away  Peyronie's disease - bending of the penis during an erection due to a hard lump called a plaque  Balanitis - inflammation of the skin covering the head of the penis; most often in men and boys who have not been circumcised  Penile cancer - a rare form of cancer; highly curable when caught early
Testicular Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/testiculardisorders.html,Testicles; or testes; make male hormones and sperm. They are two egg-shaped organs inside the scrotum; the loose sac of skin behind the penis. It's easy to injure your testicles because they are not protected by bones or muscles. Men and boys should wear athletic supporters when they play sports.  You should examine your testicles monthly and seek medical attention for lumps; redness; pain or other changes. Testicles can get inflamed or infected. They can also develop cancer. Testicular cancer is rare and highly treatable. It usually happens between the ages of 15 and 40.
Male Infertility,https://medlineplus.gov/maleinfertility.html,Infertility is a term doctors use if a man hasn't been able to get a woman pregnant after at least one year of trying. Causes of male infertility includePhysical problems with the testiclesBlockages in the ducts that carry spermHormone problemsA history of high fevers or mumpsGenetic disordersLifestyle or environmental factorsAbout a third of the time; infertility is because of a problem with the man. One third of the time; it is a problem with the woman. Sometimes no cause can be found.If you suspect you are infertile; see your doctor. There are tests that may tell if you have fertility problems. When it is possible to find the cause; treatments may include medicines; surgery; or assisted reproductive technology. Happily; many couples treated for infertility are able to have babies.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Men's Health,https://medlineplus.gov/menshealth.html,Most men need to pay more attention to their health. Compared to women; men are more likely toSmoke and drinkMake unhealthy or risky choicesPut off regular checkups and medical careThere are also health conditions that only affect men; such as prostate cancer and low testosterone. Many of the major health risks that men face - like colon cancer or heart disease - can be prevented and treated with early diagnosis. Screening tests can find diseases early; when they are easier to treat. It's important to get the screening tests you need.
Vasectomy,https://medlineplus.gov/vasectomy.html,Vasectomy is a type of surgery that prevents a man from being able to get a woman pregnant. It is a permanent form of birth control.A vasectomy works by cutting the tubes that carry the sperm out of the testicles. The surgery usually takes no more than 30 minutes.  Most men go home the same day. In most cases; recovery takes less than a week. Having a vasectomy does not affect your sex life.It takes about three months before it is effective. Your doctor will test your semen to make sure that there are no sperm in it.Vasectomies can sometimes be reversed; but not always. Having a vasectomy does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases; such as HIV/AIDS.  Men who have had a vasectomy should still practice safe sex to avoid STDs.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/cancer.html,Cancer begins in your cells; which are the building blocks of your body.   Normally; your body forms new cells as you need them; replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them; and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example; lung cancer starts in the lung; and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery; radiation and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy; immunotherapy or other types of biologic therapy; or stem cell transplantation. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Malnutrition,https://medlineplus.gov/malnutrition.html,Food provides the energy and nutrients you need to be healthy. If you don't get enough nutrients -- including proteins; carbohydrates; fats; vitamins; and minerals - you may suffer from malnutrition.Causes of malnutrition include:Lack of specific nutrients in your diet. Even the lack of one vitamin can lead to malnutrition.An unbalanced dietCertain medical problems; such as malabsorption syndromes and cancersSymptoms may include fatigue; dizziness; and weight loss.  Or; you may have no symptoms.  To diagnose the cause of the problem; your doctor may do blood tests and a nutritional assessment. Treatment may include replacing the missing nutrients and treating the underlying cause.
Breast Reconstruction,https://medlineplus.gov/breastreconstruction.html,If you need a mastectomy; you have a choice about whether or not to have surgery to rebuild the shape of the breast. Instead of breast reconstruction; you could choose to wear a breast form that replaces the breast; wear padding inside your bra; or do nothing. All of these options have pros and cons. What is right for one woman may not be right for another.Breast reconstruction may be done at the same time as the mastectomy; or it may be done later on. If radiation therapy is part of the treatment plan; your doctor may suggest waiting until after radiation therapy.If you're thinking about breast reconstruction; talk to a plastic surgeon before the mastectomy; even if you plan to have your reconstruction later on.A surgeon can reconstruct the breast in many ways. Some women choose to have breast implants; which are filled with saline or silicone gel. Another method uses tissue taken from another part of your body. The plastic surgeon can take skin; muscle; and fat from your lower abdomen; back; or buttocks.The type of reconstruction that is best for you depends on your age; body type; and the type of cancer surgery that you had. A plastic surgeon can help you decide.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Mammography,https://medlineplus.gov/mammography.html,A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast. It can be used to check for breast cancer in women who have no signs or symptoms of the disease. It can also be used if you have a lump or other sign of breast cancer.Screening mammography is the type of mammogram that checks you when you have no symptoms. It can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among women ages 40 to 70.  But it can also have drawbacks. Mammograms can sometimes find something that looks abnormal but isn't cancer. This leads to further testing and can cause you anxiety. Sometimes mammograms can miss cancer when it is there. It also exposes you to radiation. You should talk to your doctor about the benefits and drawbacks of mammograms. Together; you can decide when to start and how often to have a mammogram.Mammograms are also recommended for younger women who have symptoms of breast cancer or who have a high risk of the disease.When you have a mammogram; you stand in front of an x-ray machine. The person who takes the x-rays places your breast between two plastic plates. The plates press your breast and make it flat. This may be uncomfortable; but it helps get a clear picture. You should get a written report of your mammogram results within 30 days.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Biodefense and Bioterrorism,https://medlineplus.gov/biodefenseandbioterrorism.html,A bioterrorism attack is the deliberate release of viruses; bacteria; or other germs to cause illness or death. These germs are often found in nature. But they can sometimes be made more harmful by increasing their ability to cause disease; spread; or resist medical treatment.Biological agents spread through the air; water; or in food. Some can also spread from person to person. They can be very hard to detect. They don't cause illness for several hours or days. Scientists worry that anthrax; botulism; Ebola and other hemorrhagic fever viruses; plague; or smallpox could be used as biological agents.Biodefense uses medical measures to protect people against bioterrorism. This includes medicines and vaccinations. It also includes medical research and preparations to defend against bioterrorist attacks.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Chemical Emergencies,https://medlineplus.gov/chemicalemergencies.html,When a hazardous chemical has been released; it may harm people's health. Chemical releases can be unintentional; as in the case of an industrial accident. They could also be planned; as in the case of a terrorist attack with a chemical weapon.Some hazardous chemicals have been developed by military organizations for use in warfare. Examples are nerve agents such as sarin and VX. Many hazardous chemicals are used in industry - for example; chlorine; ammonia; and benzene. Some can be made from everyday items such as household cleaners.Although there are no guarantees of safety during a chemical emergency; you can take actions to protect yourself.  You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear; anxiety; and losses. If you do experience a disaster; it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Radiation Emergencies,https://medlineplus.gov/radiationemergencies.html,Radiation is a type of energy. People are exposed to small amounts of radiation every day from sources such as sunlight. A radiation emergency would involve larger amounts of radiation and could be caused byDirty bombs - a mix of explosives with radioactive powderFallout from a nuclear bombAccidental release from a nuclear reactor or a nuclear weapons plantA lot of radiation over a short period can cause burns or radiation sickness. If the exposure is large enough; it can cause premature aging or even death.Although there are no guarantees of safety during a radiation emergency; you can take actions to protect yourself.  You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear; anxiety and losses. If you do experience a disaster; it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Managed Care,https://medlineplus.gov/managedcare.html,Managed care plans are a type of health insurance. They have contracts with health care providers and medical facilities to provide care for members at reduced costs. These providers make up the plan's network. How much of your care the plan will pay for depends on the network's rules.Plans that restrict your choices usually cost you less. If you want a flexible plan; it will probably cost more. There are three types of managed care plans:Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) usually only pay for care within the network. You choose a primary care doctor who coordinates most of your care.Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO) usually pay more if you get care within the network. They still pay part of the cost if you go outside the network.Point of Service (POS) plans let you choose between an HMO or a PPO each time you need care.
Jaw Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/jawinjuriesanddisorders.html,Your jaw is a set of bones that holds your teeth.  It consists of two main parts. The upper part is the maxilla.  It doesn't move. The moveable lower part is called the mandible. You move it when you talk or chew. The two halves of the mandible meet at your chin. The joint where the mandible meets your skull is the temporomandibular joint.  Jaw problems include  Fractures Dislocations Temporomandibular joint dysfunction Osteonecrosis; which happens when your bones lose their blood supply Cancers  Treatment of jaw problems depends on the cause.
Bipolar Disorder,https://medlineplus.gov/bipolardisorder.html,Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness. People who have it go through unusual mood changes. They go from very happy; "up;" and active to very sad and hopeless; "down;" and inactive; and then back again. They often have normal moods in between.  The up feeling is called mania. The down feeling is depression.The causes of bipolar disorder aren't always clear. It runs in families. Abnormal brain structure and function may also play a role.Bipolar disorder often starts in a person's late teen or early adult years. But children and adults can have bipolar disorder too. The illness usually lasts a lifetime.If you think you may have it; tell your health care provider. A medical checkup can rule out other illnesses that might cause your mood changes.If not treated; bipolar disorder can lead to damaged relationships; poor job or school performance; and even suicide.  However; there are effective treatments to control symptoms: medicine and talk therapy. A combination usually works best.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
Genetic Brain Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/geneticbraindisorders.html,A genetic brain disorder is caused by a variation or a mutation in a gene.  A variation is a different form of a gene. A mutation is a change in a gene. Genetic brain disorders affect the development and function of the brain.Some genetic brain disorders are due to random gene mutations or mutations caused by environmental exposure; such as cigarette smoke. Other disorders are inherited; which means that a mutated gene or group of genes is passed down through a family. They can also be due to a combination of both genetic changes and other outside factors.Some examples of genetic brain disorders includeLeukodystrophiesPhenylketonuriaTay-Sachs diseaseWilson diseaseMany people with genetic brain disorders fail to produce enough of certain proteins that influence brain development and function. These brain disorders can cause serious problems that affect the nervous system. Some have treatments to control symptoms.  Some are life-threatening.
Marfan Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/marfansyndrome.html,Marfan syndrome is a disorder that affects connective tissue. Connective tissues are proteins that support skin; bones; blood vessels; and other organs. One of these proteins is fibrillin. A problem with the fibrillin gene causes Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome can be mild to severe; and the symptoms can vary. People with Marfan syndrome are often very tall; thin; and loose jointed. Most people with Marfan syndrome have heart and blood vessel problems; such as a weakness in the aorta or heart valves that leak. They may also have problems with their bones; eyes; skin; nervous system; and lungs.There is no single test to diagnose Marfan syndrome. Your doctor may use your medical history; family history; and a physical exam to diagnose it. Marfan syndrome has no cure; but treatments can help delay or prevent complications. Treatments include medicines; surgery; and other therapies.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Marijuana,https://medlineplus.gov/marijuana.html,Marijuana is a green; brown; or gray mix of dried; crumbled parts from the marijuana plant. It can be rolled up and smoked like a cigarette or cigar or smoked in a pipe. Sometimes people mix it in food or inhale it using a vaporizer.Marijuana can cause problems with memory; learning; and behavior. Smoking it can cause some of the same coughing and breathing problems as smoking cigarettes. Some people get addicted to marijuana after using it for a while. It is more likely to happen if they use marijuana every day; or started using it when they were teenagers.Some states have approved "medical marijuana" to ease symptoms of various health problems. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the marijuana plant as a medicine.  However; there have been scientific studies of cannabinoids; the chemicals in marijuana. This has led to two FDA-approved medicines. They contain THC; the active ingredient in marijuana. They treat nausea caused by chemotherapy and increase appetite in patients who have severe weight loss from HIV/AIDS. Scientists are doing more research with marijuana and its ingredients to treat many diseases and conditions.NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Mastectomy,https://medlineplus.gov/mastectomy.html,A mastectomy is surgery to remove a breast or part of a breast. It is usually done to treat breast cancer.  Types of breast surgery includeTotal (simple) mastectomy - removal of breast tissue and nippleModified radical mastectomy - removal of the breast; most of the lymph nodes under the arm; and often the lining over the chest musclesLumpectomy - surgery to remove the tumor and a small amount of normal tissue around itWhich surgery you have depends on the stage of cancer; size of the tumor; size of the breast; and whether the lymph nodes are involved. Many women have breast reconstruction to rebuild the breast after a mastectomy.Sometimes mastectomy is done to prevent breast cancer. Only high-risk patients have this type of surgery.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Postpartum Care,https://medlineplus.gov/postpartumcare.html,Taking home a new baby is one of the happiest times in a woman's life.  But it also presents both physical and emotional challenges.

Mild Cognitive Impairment,https://medlineplus.gov/mildcognitiveimpairment.html,Some forgetfulness can be a normal part of aging.   However; some people have more memory problems than other people their age. This condition is called mild cognitive impairment; or MCI. People with MCI can take care of themselves and do their normal activities.MCI memory problems may includeLosing things oftenForgetting to go to events and appointmentsHaving more trouble coming up with words than other people of the same ageMemory problems can also have other causes; including certain medicines and diseases that affect the blood vessels that supply the brain. Some of the problems brought on by these conditions can be managed or reversed.Your health care provider can do thinking; memory; and language tests to see if you have MCI. You may also need to see a specialist for more tests. Because MCI may be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease; it's really important to see your health care provider every 6 to 12 months.At this time; there is no proven drug treatment for MCI. Your health care provider can check to see if you have any changes in your memory or thinking skills over time.NIH: National Institute on Aging

Myelodysplastic Syndromes,https://medlineplus.gov/myelodysplasticsyndromes.html,Your bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside some of your bones; such as your hip and thigh bones. It contains immature cells; called stem cells. The stem cells can develop into the red blood cells that carry oxygen through your body; the white blood cells that fight infections; and the platelets that help with blood clotting. If you have a myelodysplastic syndrome; the stem cells do not mature into healthy blood cells. Many of them die in the bone marrow.  This means that you do not have enough healthy cells; which can lead to infection; anemia; or easy bleeding.Myelodysplastic syndromes often do not cause early symptoms and are sometimes found during a routine blood test.  If you have symptoms; they may includeShortness of breathWeakness or feeling tiredSkin that is paler than usualEasy bruising or bleedingPinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleedingFever or frequent infectionsMyelodysplastic syndromes are rare. People at higher risk are over 60; have had chemotherapy or radiation therapy; or have been exposed to certain chemicals.  Treatment options include transfusions; drug therapy; chemotherapy; and blood or bone marrow stem cell transplants.NIH: National Cancer Institute

Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/medicines.html,You may need to take medicines every day; or only once in a while.  Either way; you want to make sure that the medicines are safe and will help you get better. In the United States; the Food and Drug Administration is in charge of assuring the safety and effectiveness of both prescription and over-the-counter medicines.

Aside from drugs for fever or pain; most over-the-counter products haven't actually been studied in children for effectiveness; safety; or dosing. When you give medicine to your child; be sure you're giving the right medicine and the right amount. Read and follow the label directions.  Use the correct dosing device. If the label says two teaspoons and you're using a dosing cup with ounces only; don't guess. Get the proper measuring device. Don't substitute another item; such as a kitchen spoon. Talk to your doctor; pharmacist; or other health care provider before giving two medicines at the same time. That way; you can avoid a possible overdose or an unwanted interaction. Follow age and weight limit recommendations. If the label says don't give to children under a certain age or weight; don't do it. Food and Drug Administration

Other treatments include chemotherapy and radiation; biologic; and targeted therapies.  Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Memory,https://medlineplus.gov/memory.html,Every day; you have different experiences and you learn new things. Your brain cannot store all of that information; so it has to decide what is worth remembering. Memory is the process of storing and then remembering this information. There are different types of memory. Short-term memory stores information for a few seconds or minutes. Long-term memory stores it for a longer period of time.Memory doesn't always work perfectly. As you grow older; it may take longer to remember things.It's normal to forget things once in awhile. We've all forgotten a name; where we put our keys; or if we locked the front door. If you are a senior who forget things more often than others your age; you may have mild cognitive impairment. Forgetting how to use your phone or find your way home may be signs of a more serious problem; such asAlzheimer's diseaseOther types of dementiaStrokeDepressionHead injuriesBlood clots or tumors in the brainKidney; liver; or thyroid problemsReactions to certain medicinesIf you're worried about your forgetfulness; see your health care provider.NIH: National Institute on Aging

Others may have many attacks close together over several days. Some people with Meniere's disease have "drop attacks" during which the  dizziness is so bad they lose their balance and fall.Scientists don't yet know the cause. They think that it has to do with the fluid levels or the mixing of fluids in the canals of your inner ear.  Doctors diagnose it based on a physical exam and your symptoms. A hearing test can check to see how it has affected your hearing.There is no cure. Treatments include medicines to control dizziness; limiting salt in your diet; and taking water pills. A device that fits into the outer ear and delivers air pulses to the middle ear can help. Severe cases may require surgery.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders

It usually lasts more than a few minutes. It may go away and come back. It can feel like pressure; squeezing; fullness; or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion.Shortness of breath. Sometimes this is your only symptom. You may get it before or during the chest discomfort. It can happen when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.Discomfort in the upper body. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms; the back; shoulders; neck; jaw; or upper part of the stomach.You may also have other symptoms; such as nausea; vomiting; dizziness; and lightheadedness. You may break out in a cold sweat. Sometimes women will have different symptoms then men. For example; they are more likely to feel tired for no reason.The most common cause of heart attacks is coronary artery disease (CAD). With CAD; there is a buildup of cholesterol and other material; called plaque; on their inner walls or the arteries. This is atherosclerosis. It can build up for years. Eventually an area of plaque can rupture (break open). A blood clot can form around the plaque and block the artery.A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery.At the hospital; health care providers make a diagnosis based on your symptoms; blood tests; and different heart health tests. Treatments may include medicines and medical procedures such as coronary angioplasty. After a heart attack; cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle changes can help you recover.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Urine and Urination,https://medlineplus.gov/urineandurination.html,Your kidneys make urine by filtering wastes and extra water from your blood. The waste is called urea. Your blood carries it to the kidneys. From the kidneys; urine travels down two thin tubes called ureters to the bladder. The bladder stores urine until you are ready to urinate. It swells into a round shape when it is full and gets smaller when empty. If your urinary system is healthy; your bladder can hold up to 16 ounces (2 cups) of urine comfortably for 2 to 5 hours.You may have problems with urination if you haveKidney failureUrinary tract infections An enlarged prostateBladder control problems like  incontinence; overactive bladder; or interstitial cystitisA blockage that prevents you from emptying your bladder Some conditions may also cause you to have blood or protein in your urine. If you have a urinary problem; see your health care provider. Urinalysis and other urine tests can help to diagnose the problem. Treatment depends on the cause.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Coronavirus Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/coronavirusinfections.html,Coronaviruses are common viruses that most people get some time in their life. They are common throughout the world; and they can infect people and animals. Several different coronaviruses can infect people and make them sick. They usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory illness. But; some coronaviruses can cause severe illness.Coronaviruses probably spread through the air by coughing or sneezing; or by close personal contact. If you get infected; symptoms may includeRunny noseCoughSore throatFeverYou may be able to reduce your risk of infection by washing your hands often with soap and water; not touching your eyes; nose; or mouth; and avoiding close contact with people who are sick. There is no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection. There are no specific treatments. You can relieve symptoms with pain and fever medicines and rest.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Migraine,https://medlineplus.gov/migraine.html,If you suffer from migraine headaches; you're not alone. About 12 percent of the U.S. population gets them.  Migraines are recurring attacks of moderate to severe pain.  The pain is throbbing or pulsing; and is often on one side of the head. During migraines; people are very sensitive to light and sound. They may also become nauseated and vomit.  Migraine is three times more common in women than in men. Some people can tell when they are about to have a migraine because they see flashing lights or zigzag lines or they temporarily lose their vision.  Many things can trigger a migraine. These include    Anxiety  Stress  Lack of food or sleep   Exposure to light  Hormonal changes (in women)  Doctors used to believe migraines were linked to the opening and narrowing of blood vessels in the head. Now they believe the cause is related to genes that control the activity of some brain cells.  Medicines can help prevent migraine attacks or help relieve symptoms of attacks when they happen. For many people; treatments to relieve stress can also help. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Mild Cognitive Impairment,https://medlineplus.gov/mildcognitiveimpairment.html,Some forgetfulness can be a normal part of aging.   However; some people have more memory problems than other people their age. This condition is called mild cognitive impairment; or MCI. People with MCI can take care of themselves and do their normal activities.MCI memory problems may includeLosing things oftenForgetting to go to events and appointmentsHaving more trouble coming up with words than other people of the same ageMemory problems can also have other causes; including certain medicines and diseases that affect the blood vessels that supply the brain. Some of the problems brought on by these conditions can be managed or reversed.Your health care provider can do thinking; memory; and language tests to see if you have MCI. You may also need to see a specialist for more tests. Because MCI may be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease; it's really important to see your health care provider every 6 to 12 months.At this time; there is no proven drug treatment for MCI. Your health care provider can check to see if you have any changes in your memory or thinking skills over time.NIH: National Institute on Aging
Veterans and Military Health,https://medlineplus.gov/veteransandmilitaryhealth.html,Military service members and veterans have made sacrifices to our country; and they face different health issues than civilians. During their service; they are at risk for various injuries. These injuries can happen during combat; while others involve physical stress to the body. Sometimes the injuries are life-threatening or serious enough to cause disability. Others may not be as serious; but can be painful and affect daily life. Specific types of injuries include Shrapnel and gunshot woundsLost limbsHead and brain injuriesTinnitus and hearing loss; typically from exposure to noiseSprains and strainsLimited range of motion; especially in ankles and kneesThere may also be a risk of health problems from exposure to environmental hazards; such as contaminated water; chemicals; infections; and burn pits.Being in combat and being separated from your family can be stressful. The stress can put service members and veterans at risk for mental health problems. These include anxiety; post-traumatic stress disorder; depression and substance abuse. Suicide can also be a concern.
Food Allergy,https://medlineplus.gov/foodallergy.html,Food allergy is an abnormal response to a food triggered by your body's immune system.In adults; the foods that most often trigger allergic reactions include fish; shellfish; peanuts; and tree nuts; such as walnuts. Problem foods for children can include eggs; milk; peanuts; tree nuts; soy; and wheat.The allergic reaction may be mild. In rare cases it can cause a severe reaction called anaphylaxis. Symptoms of food allergy includeItching or swelling in your mouthVomiting; diarrhea; or abdominal cramps and painHives or eczemaTightening of the throat and trouble breathingDrop in blood pressureYour health care provider may use a detailed history; elimination diet; and skin and blood tests to diagnose a food allergy.When you have food allergies; you must be prepared to treat an accidental exposure. Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace; and carry an auto-injector device containing epinephrine (adrenaline).You can only prevent the symptoms of food allergy by avoiding the food. After you and your health care provider have identified the foods to which you are sensitive; you must remove them from your diet.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Lactose Intolerance,https://medlineplus.gov/lactoseintolerance.html,Lactose intolerance means that you cannot digest foods with lactose in them. Lactose is the sugar found in milk and foods made with milk. After eating foods with lactose in them; you may feel sick to your stomach. You may also have  Gas  Diarrhea  Swelling in your stomach   Your doctor may do a blood; breath or stool test to find out if your problems are due to lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance is not serious.  Eating less food with lactose; or using pills or drops to help you digest lactose usually helps. You may need to take a calcium supplement if you don't get enough of it from your diet; since milk and foods made with milk are the most common source of calcium for most people. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Minerals,https://medlineplus.gov/minerals.html,Minerals are important for your body to stay healthy. Your body uses minerals for many different jobs; including keeping your bones; muscles; heart; and brain working properly. Minerals are also important for making enzymes and hormones.There are two kinds of minerals: macrominerals and trace minerals. You need larger amounts of macrominerals. They include calcium; phosphorus; magnesium; sodium; potassium; chloride and sulfur. You only need small amounts of trace minerals. They include iron; manganese; copper; iodine; zinc; cobalt; fluoride and selenium. Most people get the amount of minerals they need by eating a wide variety of foods. In some cases; your doctor may recommend a mineral supplement. People who have certain health problems or take some medicines may need to get less of one of the minerals. For example; people with chronic kidney disease need to limit foods that are high in potassium.
Transient Ischemic Attack,https://medlineplus.gov/transientischemicattack.html,A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a stroke lasts only a few minutes. It happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is briefly blocked. Symptoms of a TIA are like other stroke symptoms; but do not last as long. They happen suddenly; and includeNumbness or weakness; especially on one side of the bodyConfusion or trouble speaking or understanding speechTrouble seeing in one or both eyesDifficulty walkingDizzinessLoss of balance or coordinationMost symptoms of a TIA disappear within an hour; although they may last for up to 24 hours. Because you cannot tell if these symptoms are from a TIA or a stroke; you should go to the hospital right away.TIAs are often a warning sign for future strokes. Taking medicine; such as blood thinners; may reduce your risk of a stroke. Your doctor might also recommend surgery. You can also help lower your risk by having a healthy lifestyle. This includes not smoking; not drinking too much; eating a healthy diet; and exercising. It is also important to control other health problems; such as high blood pressure and cholesterol.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Miscarriage,https://medlineplus.gov/miscarriage.html,A miscarriage is an unexpected loss of pregnancy before the 20th week of pregnancy. Most miscarriages happen very early in the pregnancy; often before a woman even knows she is pregnant.Factors that may contribute to miscarriage includeA genetic problem with the fetusProblems with the uterus or cervixChronic diseases; such as polycystic ovary syndromeSigns of a miscarriage include vaginal spotting; abdominal pain or cramping; and fluid or tissue passing from the vagina. Bleeding can be a symptom of miscarriage; but many women also have it in early pregnancy and don't miscarry. To be sure; contact your health care provider right away if you have bleeding.Women who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not need any treatment. In some cases; there is tissue left in the uterus. Doctors use a procedure called a dilatation and curettage (D&C) or medicines to remove the tissue.Counseling may help you cope with your grief. Later; if you do decide to try again; work closely with your health care provider to lower the risks. Many women who have a miscarriage go on to have healthy babies.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Mitochondrial Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/mitochondrialdiseases.html,Metabolism is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Food is made up of proteins; carbohydrates; and fats. Chemicals in your digestive system (enzymes) break the food parts down into sugars and acids; your body's fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away; or it can store the energy in your body tissues. If you have a metabolic disorder; something goes wrong with this process.Mitochondrial diseases are a group of metabolic disorders. Mitochondria are small structures that produce energy in almost all of your cells. They make it by combining oxygen with the fuel molecules (sugars and fats) that come from your food. When the mitochondria are defective; the cells do not have enough energy. The unused oxygen and fuel molecules build up in the cells and cause damage.The symptoms of mitochondrial disease can vary. It depends on how many mitochondria are defective; and where they are in the body. Sometimes only one organ; tissue; or cell type is affected. But often the problem affects many of them. Muscle and nerve cells have especially high energy needs; so muscular and neurological problems are common. The diseases range from mild to severe. Some types can be fatal.Genetic mutations cause these diseases. They usually happen before age 20; and some are more common in infants. There are no cures for these diseases; but treatments may help with symptoms and slow down the disease. They may include physical therapy; vitamins and supplements; special diets; and medicines.
Mitral Valve Prolapse,https://medlineplus.gov/mitralvalveprolapse.html,Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) occurs when one of your heart's valves doesn't work properly. The flaps of the valve are "floppy" and don't close tightly. Most people who have the condition are born with it. It also tends to run in families.Most of the time; MVP doesn't cause any problems. Rarely; blood can leak the wrong way through the floppy valve. This can causePalpitations (feelings that your heart is skipping a beat; fluttering; or beating too hard or too fast)Shortness of breathCoughFatigue; dizziness; or anxietyMigraine headachesChest discomfortMost people who have mitral valve prolapse (MVP) don't need treatment because they don't have symptoms and complications. If you need treatment for MVP; medicines can help relieve symptoms or prevent complications. Very few people will need surgery to repair or replace the mitral valve.MVP puts you at risk for infective endocarditis; a kind of heart infection. To prevent it; doctors used to prescribe antibiotics before dental work or certain surgeries.  Now; only people at high risk of endocarditis need the antibiotics.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Connective Tissue Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/connectivetissuedisorders.html,Your connective tissue supports many different parts of your body; such as your skin; eyes; and heart. It is like a "cellular glue" that gives your body parts their shape and helps keep them strong. It also helps some of your tissues do their work. It is made of many kinds of proteins. Cartilage and fat are types of connective tissue.Over 200 disorders that impact connective tissue. There are different types:Genetic disorders; such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; Marfan syndrome; and osteogenesis imperfectaAutoimmune disorders; such as lupus and sclerodermaCancers; like some types of soft tissue sarcomaEach disorder has its own symptoms and needs different treatment. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Mobility Aids,https://medlineplus.gov/mobilityaids.html,Mobility aids help you walk or move from place to place if you are disabled or have an injury. They includeCrutchesCanesWalkersWheelchairsMotorized scootersYou may need a walker or cane if you are at risk of falling. If you need to keep your body weight off your foot; ankle or knee; you may need crutches. You may need a wheelchair or a scooter if an injury or disease has left you unable to walk. Choosing these devices takes time and research. You should be fitted for crutches; canes and walkers. If they fit; these devices give you support; but if they don't fit; they can be uncomfortable and unsafe.
Tumors and Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/tumorsandpregnancy.html,Tumors during pregnancy are rare; but they can happen. Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. The most common cancers in pregnancy are breast cancer; cervical cancer; lymphoma; and melanoma.  Cancer itself rarely harms the baby; and some cancer treatments are safe during pregnancy.  You and your health care provider will work together to find the best treatment.  Your options will depend on how far along the pregnancy is; as well as the type; size; and stage of your cancer.Another type of tumor that women can get is called a gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). It happens when a fertilized egg doesn't become a fetus.  GTD is not always easy to find.  It is usually benign; but some types can be malignant. The most common type of GTD is a molar pregnancy. In its early stages; it may look like a normal pregnancy. You should see your health care provider if you have vaginal bleeding (not menstrual bleeding). Treatment depends on the type of tumor; whether it has spread to other places; and your overall health.
Molds,https://medlineplus.gov/molds.html,Molds are fungi that can be found both outdoors and indoors. They grow best in warm; damp and humid conditions. If you have damp or wet spots in your house; you will probably get mold.Molds can cause health problems. Inhaling or touching mold or mold spores may cause allergic reactions or asthma attacks in sensitive people. Molds can cause fungal infections. In addition; mold exposure may irritate your eyes; skin; nose; throat; and lungs. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Moles,https://medlineplus.gov/moles.html,Moles are growths on the skin. They happen when pigment cells in the skin; called melanocytes; grow in clusters. Moles are very common. Most people have between 10 and 40 moles. A person may develop new moles from time to time; usually until about age 40. In older people; they tend to fade away.Moles are usually pink; tan or brown. They can be flat or raised. They are usually round or oval and no larger than a pencil eraser.About one out of every ten people has at least one unusual (or atypical) mole that looks different from an ordinary mole. They are called dysplastic nevi. They may be more likely than ordinary moles to develop into melanoma; a type of skin cancer. You should have a health care professional check your moles if they look unusual; grow larger; change in color or outline; or in any other way.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Skin Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/skininfections.html,Your skin helps protect you from germs; but sometimes it can get infected by them.  Some common types of skin infections are  Bacterial: Cellulitis and impetigo. Staphylococcal infections can also affect the skin. Viral: Shingles; warts; and  herpes simplex Fungal: Athlete's foot and yeast infections Parasitic:  Body lice; head lice; and scabies  Treatment of skin infections depends on the cause.
Yeast Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/yeastinfections.html,Candida is the scientific name for yeast. It is a fungus that lives almost everywhere; including in your body. Usually; your immune system keeps yeast under control. If you are sick or taking antibiotics; it can multiply and cause an infection. Yeast infections affect different parts of the body in different ways: Thrush is a yeast infection that causes white patches in your mouth Candida esophagitis is thrush that spreads to your esophagus; the tube that takes food from your mouth to your stomach. It can make it hard or painful to swallow. Women can get vaginal yeast infections; causing vaginitisYeast infections of the skin cause itching and rashes Yeast infections in your bloodstream can be life-threatening Antifungal medicines get rid of yeast infections in most people. If you have a weak immune system; treatment might be more difficult.
Monkeypox Virus Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/monkeypoxvirusinfections.html,Monkeypox is a rare viral disease. It occurs mostly in central and western Africa. Wild rodents and squirrels carry it; but it is called monkeypox because scientists saw it first in lab monkeys. In 2003; it was reported in prairie dogs and humans in the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Infectious Mononucleosis,https://medlineplus.gov/infectiousmononucleosis.html,Infectious mononucleosis; or "mono"; is an infection usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. The virus spreads through saliva; which is why it's sometimes called "kissing disease." Mono occurs most often in teens and young adults. However; you can get it at any age.  Symptoms of mono includeFeverSore throatSwollen lymph glandsSometimes you may also have a swollen spleen.  Serious problems are rare. A blood test can show if you have mono. Most people get better in two to four weeks. However; you may feel tired for a few months afterward. Treatment focuses on helping symptoms and includes medicines for pain and fever; warm salt water gargles and plenty of rest and fluids.

Mood Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/mooddisorders.html,Most people feel sad or irritable from time to time. They may say they're in a bad mood. A mood disorder is different. It affects a person's everyday emotional state. Nearly one in ten people aged 18 and older have mood disorders. These include depression and bipolar disorder (also called manic depression).Mood disorders can increase a person's risk for heart disease; diabetes; and other diseases. Treatments include medication; psychotherapy; or a combination of both. With treatment; most people with mood disorders can lead productive lives.
Scleroderma,https://medlineplus.gov/scleroderma.html,Scleroderma means hard skin. It is a group of diseases that cause abnormal growth of connective tissue.  Connective tissue is the material inside your body that gives your tissues their shape and helps keep them strong. In scleroderma; the tissue gets hard or thick. It can cause swelling or pain in your muscles and joints.Symptoms of scleroderma include Calcium deposits in connective tissues Raynaud's phenomenon; a narrowing of  blood vessels in the hands or feetSwelling of the esophagus; the tube between your throat and stomachThick; tight skin on your fingersRed spots on your hands and face No one knows what causes scleroderma. It is more common in women. It can be mild or severe. Doctors diagnose scleroderma using your medical history; a physical exam; lab tests; and a skin biopsy. There is no cure; but various treatments can control symptoms and complications. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Foot Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/footinjuriesanddisorders.html,Each of your feet has 26 bones; 33 joints; and more than 100 tendons; muscles; and ligaments. No wonder a lot of things can go wrong. Here are a few common problems:Bunions - hard; painful bumps on the big toe joint Corns and calluses - thickened skin from friction or pressure Plantar warts - warts on the soles of your feet Fallen arches - also called flat feet Ill-fitting shoes often cause these problems. Aging and being overweight also increase your chances of having foot problems.
Mosquito Bites,https://medlineplus.gov/mosquitobites.html,Mosquitoes are insects that live all over the world. There are thousands of different species of mosquitoes; about 200 of those live in the United States.Female mosquitoes bite animals and humans and drink a very small amount of their blood. They need protein and iron from blood to produce eggs. After drinking blood; they find some standing water and lay their eggs in it. The eggs hatch into larvae; then pupae; and then they become adult mosquitos. The males live for about a week to ten days; and the females can live up to several weeks. Some female mosquitoes can hibernate in the winter; and they can live for months.What health problems can mosquito bites cause?Most mosquito bites are harmless; but there are times when they can be dangerous. The ways that mosquito bites can affect humans includeCausing itchy bumps; as an immune system response to the mosquito's saliva. This is the most common reaction. The bumps usually go away after a day or two.Causing allergic reactions; including blisters; large hives; and in rare cases; anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that affects the whole body. It is a medical emergency.Spreading diseases to humans. Some of these diseases can be serious. Many of them do not have any treatments; and only a few have vaccines to prevent them. These diseases are more of a problem in Africa and other tropical areas of the world; but more of them are spreading to the United States. One factor is climate change; which makes the conditions in some parts of the United States more favorable to certain types of mosquitoes. Other reasons include increased trade with; and travel to; tropical and subtropical areas.Which diseases can mosquitoes spread?Common diseases spread by mosquitoes includeChikungunya; a viral infection that causes symptoms such as fever and severe joint pain. The symptoms usually last about a week; but for some; the joint pain may last for months. Most cases of chikungunya in the United States are in people who traveled to other countries. There have been a few cases where it has spread in the United States.Dengue; a viral infection that causes a high fever; headaches; joint and muscle pain; vomiting; and a rash. Most people get better within a few weeks. In some cases; it can become very severe; even life-threatening. Dengue is rare in the United States.Malaria; a parasitic disease that causes serious symptoms such as high fevers; shaking chills; and flu-like illness. It can be life-threatening; but there are drugs to treat it. Malaria is a major health problem in many tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Almost all cases of malaria in the United States are in people who traveled to other countries.West Nile Virus (WNV); a viral infection that often has no symptoms. In those that do have symptoms; they are usually mild; and include fever; headache; and nausea. In rare cases; the virus can enter the brain; and it can be life-threatening. WNV has spread across the continental United States.Zika Virus; a viral infection that often does not cause symptoms. One in five infected people do get symptoms; which are usually mild. They include a fever; rash; joint pain; and pinkeye. Besides being spread by mosquitoes; Zika can spread from mother to baby during pregnancy and cause serious birth defects. It can also spread from one partner to another during sex. There have been a few outbreaks of Zika in the southern United States.How can I prevent mosquito bites?Use an insect repellent when you go outdoors. Choose an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. They are evaluated to make sure they are safe and effective. Make sure that the repellant has one of these ingredients: DEET; picaridin; IR3535; oil of lemon eucalyptus; or para-menthane-diol. It is important to follow the instructions on the label.Cover up. Wear long sleeves; long pants; and socks when outdoors. Mosquitoes may bite through thin fabric; so spray thin clothes with an EPA-registered repellent like permethrin. Don't apply permethrin directly to skin.Mosquito-proof your home. Install or repair screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out. Use air conditioning if you have it.Get rid of mosquito breeding sites. Regularly empty standing water from your house and yard. The water could be in flowerpots; gutters; buckets; pool covers; pet water dishes; discarded tires; or birdbaths.If you plan to travel; get information about the areas you will be going to. Find out whether there is a risk of diseases from mosquitoes; and if so; whether there is a vaccine or medicine to prevent those diseases. See a health care provider familiar with travel medicine; ideally 4 to 6 weeks before your trip.
Motion Sickness,https://medlineplus.gov/motionsickness.html,Motion sickness is a common problem in people traveling by car; train; airplanes; and especially boats. Anyone can get it; but it is more common in children; pregnant women; and people taking certain medicines. Motion sickness can start suddenly; with a queasy feeling and cold sweats. It can then lead to dizziness and nausea and vomiting.Your brain senses movement by getting signals from your inner ears; eyes; muscles; and joints. When it gets signals that do not match; you can get motion sickness. For example; if you are reading on your phone while riding a bus; your eyes are focused on something that is not moving; but your inner ear senses motion.Where you sit can make a difference. The front seat of a car; forward cars of a train; upper deck on a boat or wing seats in a plane may give you a smoother ride. Looking out into the distance - instead of trying to read or look at something in the vehicle - can also help. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Motor Vehicle Safety,https://medlineplus.gov/motorvehiclesafety.html,Every year thousands of people in the U.S. die from motor vehicle crashes. Trying to prevent these crashes is one part of motor vehicle safety.  Here are some things you can do to be safer on the road: Make sure your vehicle is safe and in working order Use car seats for children Wear your seat belt Don't speed or drive aggressively Don't drive impairedSafety also involves being aware of others. Share the road with bicycles and motorcycles; and watch for pedestrians.
Oral Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/oralcancer.html,Oral cancer can form in any part of the mouth. Most oral cancers begin in the flat cells that cover the surfaces of your mouth; tongue; and lips. Anyone can get oral cancer; but the risk is higher if you are male; use tobacco; drink lots of alcohol; have HPV; or have a history of head or neck cancer. Frequent sun exposure is also a risk factor for lip cancer. Symptoms of oral cancer include White or red patches in your mouthA mouth sore that won't healBleeding in your mouthLoose teethProblems or pain with swallowingA lump in your neckAn earacheTests to diagnose oral cancer include a physical exam; endoscopy; biopsy; and imaging tests. Oral cancer treatments may include surgery; radiation therapy; and chemotherapy. Some patients have a combination of treatments. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Mouth Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/mouthdisorders.html,Your mouth is one of the most important parts of your body. Any problem that affects your mouth can make it hard to eat; drink or even smile.  Some common mouth problems include  Cold sores -  painful sores on the lips and around the mouth; caused by a virus Canker sores - painful sores in the mouth; caused by bacteria or viruses Thrush -  a yeast infection that causes white patches in your mouth  Leukoplakia - white patches of excess cell growth on the cheeks; gums or tongue; common in smokers Dry mouth - a lack of enough saliva; caused by some medicines and certain diseases Gum or tooth problems Bad breath  Treatment for mouth disorders varies; depending on the problem. Keeping a clean mouth by brushing and flossing often is important.
Movement Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/movementdisorders.html,Imagine if parts of your body moved when you didn't want them to. If you have a movement disorder; you experience these kinds of impaired movement. Dyskinesia is abnormal uncontrolled movement and is a common symptom of many movement disorders. Tremors are a type of dyskinesia. Nerve diseases cause many movement disorders; such as Parkinson's disease. Other causes include injuries; autoimmune diseases; infections and certain medicines. Many movement disorders are inherited; which means they run in families.Treatment varies by disorder. Medicine can cure some disorders. Others get better when an underlying disease is treated. Often; however; there is no cure. In that case; the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms and relieve pain.
MRI Scans,https://medlineplus.gov/mriscans.html,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a large magnet and radio waves to look at organs and structures inside your body. Health care professionals use MRI scans to diagnose a variety of conditions; from torn ligaments to tumors. MRIs are very useful for examining the brain and spinal cord. During the scan; you lie on a table that slides inside a tunnel-shaped machine. Doing the scan can take a long time; and you must stay still. The scan is painless. The MRI machine makes a lot of noise. The technician may offer you earplugs.Before you get a scan; tell your doctor if you Are pregnant Have pieces of metal in your body. You might have metal in your body if you have a shrapnel or bullet injury or if you are a welder.Have metal or electronic devices in your body; such as a cardiac pacemaker or a metal artificial joint
MRSA,https://medlineplus.gov/mrsa.html,MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  It causes a staph infection (pronounced "staff infection") that is resistant to several common antibiotics. There are two types of infection. Hospital-associated MRSA happens to people in health care settings. Community-associated MRSA happens to people who have close skin-to-skin contact with others; such as athletes involved in football and wrestling.Infection control is key to stopping MRSA in hospitals. To prevent community-associated MRSAPractice good hygieneKeep cuts and scrapes clean and covered with a bandage until healedAvoid contact with other people's wounds or bandagesAvoid sharing personal items; such as towels; washcloths; razors; or clothesWash soiled sheets; towels; and clothes in hot water with bleach and dry in a hot dryerIf a wound appears to be infected; see a health care provider. Treatments may include draining the infection and antibiotics.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Multiple Sclerosis,https://medlineplus.gov/multiplesclerosis.html,Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a nervous system disease that affects your brain and spinal cord.  It damages the myelin sheath; the material that surrounds and protects your nerve cells. This damage slows down or blocks messages between your brain and your body; leading to the symptoms of MS. They can includeVisual disturbancesMuscle weaknessTrouble with coordination and balanceSensations such as numbness; prickling; or "pins and needles" Thinking and memory problemsNo one knows what causes MS. It may be an autoimmune disease; which happens when your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Multiple sclerosis affects women more than men. It often begins between the ages of 20 and 40.  Usually; the disease is mild; but some people lose the ability to write; speak; or walk.There is no single test for MS.  Doctors use a medical history; physical exam; neurological exam; MRI; and other tests to diagnose it. There is no cure for MS; but medicines may slow it down and help control symptoms. Physical and occupational therapy may also help.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Kawasaki Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/kawasakidisease.html,Kawasaki disease is a rare childhood disease. It makes the walls of the blood vessels in the body become inflamed. It can affect any type of blood vessel; including the arteries; veins; and capillaries.No one knows what causes Kawasaki disease.  Symptoms include High fever that lasts longer than 5 daysSwollen lymph nodes in the neckA rash on the mid-section and genital areaRed; dry; cracked lips and a red; swollen tongueRed; swollen palms of the hands and soles of the feetRedness of the eyes Kawasaki disease can't be passed from one child to another. There is no single test.  To diagnose it; doctors look at the signs and symptoms. They may also use an echocardiogram or other tests. It is mainly treated with medicines. Rarely; medical procedures and surgery also may be used for children whose coronary arteries are affected. Kawasaki disease can't be prevented. However; most children who develop the disease fully recover - usually within weeks of getting signs and symptoms. Further problems are rare.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Metabolic Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/metabolicdisorders.html,Metabolism is the process your body uses to get or make energy from the food you eat. Food is made up of proteins; carbohydrates; and fats. Chemicals in your digestive system break the food parts down into sugars and acids; your body's fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away; or it can store the energy in your body tissues; such as your liver; muscles; and body fat.A metabolic disorder occurs when abnormal chemical reactions in your body disrupt this process. When this happens; you might have too much of some substances or too little of other ones that you need to stay healthy. There are different groups of disorders. Some affect the breakdown of amino acids; carbohydrates; or lipids. Another group; mitochondrial diseases; affects the parts of the cells that produce the energy.You can develop a metabolic disorder when some organs; such as your liver or pancreas; become diseased or do not function normally. Diabetes is an example.
Carbohydrate Metabolism Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/carbohydratemetabolismdisorders.html,Metabolism is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Food is made up of proteins; carbohydrates; and fats. Chemicals in your digestive system (enzymes) break the food parts down into sugars and acids; your body's fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away; or it can store the energy in your body tissues. If you have a metabolic disorder; something goes wrong with this process.Carbohydrate metabolism disorders are a group of metabolic disorders. Normally your enzymes break carbohydrates down into glucose (a type of sugar). If you have one of these disorders; you may not have enough enzymes to break down the carbohydrates. Or the enzymes may not work properly. This causes a harmful amount of sugar to build up in your body. That can lead to health problems; some of which can be serious. Some of the disorders are fatal.These disorders are inherited. Newborn babies get screened for many of them; using blood tests. If there is a family history of one of these disorders; parents can get genetic testing to see whether they carry the gene. Other genetic tests can tell whether the fetus has the disorder or carries the gene for the disorder.Treatments may include special diets; supplements; and medicines. Some babies may also need additional treatments; if there are complications. For some disorders; there is no cure; but treatments may help with symptoms.
Arrhythmia,https://medlineplus.gov/arrhythmia.html,An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. It means that your heart beats too quickly; too slowly; or with an irregular pattern. When the heart beats faster than normal; it is called tachycardia. When the heart beats too slowly; it is called bradycardia. The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation; which causes an irregular and fast heart beat.Many factors can affect your heart's rhythm; such as having had a heart attack; smoking; congenital heart defects; and stress. Some substances or medicines may also cause arrhythmias. Symptoms of arrhythmias includeFast or slow heart beatSkipping beatsLightheadedness or dizzinessChest painShortness of breath Sweating Your doctor can run tests to find out if you have an arrhythmia. Treatment to restore a normal heart rhythm may include medicines; an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker; or sometimes surgery. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Twins, Triplets, Multiple Births,https://medlineplus.gov/twinstripletsmultiplebirths.html,If you are pregnant with more than one baby; you are far from alone. Multiple births are up in the United States.  More women are having babies after age 30 and more are taking fertility drugs. Both boost the chance of carrying more than one baby. A family history of twins also makes multiples more likely.Years ago; most twins came as a surprise. Now; most women know about a multiple pregnancy early. Women with multiple pregnancies should see their health care providers more often than women who are expecting one baby. Multiple pregnancy babies have a much higher risk of being born prematurely and having a low birth weight.  There is also more of a risk of disabilities. Some women have to go on bed rest to delay labor. Finally; they may deliver by C-section; especially if there are three babies or more.Parenting multiples can be a challenge. Volunteer help and support groups for parents of multiples can help.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Endocrine Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/endocrinediseases.html,Your endocrine system includes eight major glands throughout your body. These glands make hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers.  They travel through your bloodstream to tissues or organs. Hormones work slowly and affect body processes from head to toe. These include  Growth and development Metabolism - digestion; elimination; breathing; blood circulation and maintaining body temperature  Sexual function Reproduction Mood  If your hormone levels are too high or too low; you may have a hormone disorder. Hormone diseases also occur if your body does not respond to hormones the way it is supposed to.  Stress; infection and changes in your blood's fluid and electrolyte balance can also influence hormone levels. In the United States; the most common endocrine disease is diabetes. There are many others. They are usually treated by controlling how much hormone your body makes. Hormone supplements can help if the problem is too little of a hormone.
Parathyroid Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/parathyroiddisorders.html,Most people have four pea-sized glands; called parathyroid glands; on the thyroid gland in the neck. Though their names are similar; the thyroid and parathyroid glands are completely different. The parathyroid glands make parathyroid hormone (PTH); which helps your body keep the right balance of calcium and phosphorous.If your parathyroid glands make too much or too little hormone; it disrupts this balance. If they secrete extra PTH; you have hyperparathyroidism; and your blood calcium rises. In many cases; a benign tumor on a parathyroid gland makes it overactive. Or; the extra hormones can come from enlarged parathyroid glands. Very rarely; the cause is cancer.If you do not have enough PTH; you have hypoparathyroidism. Your blood will have too little calcium and too much phosphorous. Causes include injury to the glands; endocrine disorders; or genetic conditions. Treatment is aimed at restoring the balance of calcium and phosphorous.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Multiple Myeloma,https://medlineplus.gov/multiplemyeloma.html,Multiple myeloma is a cancer that begins in plasma cells; a type of white blood cell. These cells are part of your immune system; which helps protect the body from germs and other harmful substances. In time; myeloma cells collect in the bone marrow and in the solid parts of bones.No one knows the exact causes of multiple myeloma; but it is more common in older people and African Americans. It can run in families. Common symptoms may includeBone pain; often in the back or ribsBroken bonesWeakness or fatigueWeight lossFrequent infections and feversFeeling very thirstyFrequent urinationDoctors diagnose multiple myeloma using lab tests; imaging tests; and a bone marrow biopsy.  Your treatment depends on how advanced the disease is and whether you have symptoms.  If you have no symptoms; you may not need treatment right away. If you have symptoms; you may have chemotherapy; stem cell transplantation; radiation; or targeted therapy.  Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Multiple Sclerosis,https://medlineplus.gov/multiplesclerosis.html,Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a nervous system disease that affects your brain and spinal cord.  It damages the myelin sheath; the material that surrounds and protects your nerve cells. This damage slows down or blocks messages between your brain and your body; leading to the symptoms of MS. They can includeVisual disturbancesMuscle weaknessTrouble with coordination and balanceSensations such as numbness; prickling; or "pins and needles" Thinking and memory problemsNo one knows what causes MS. It may be an autoimmune disease; which happens when your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Multiple sclerosis affects women more than men. It often begins between the ages of 20 and 40.  Usually; the disease is mild; but some people lose the ability to write; speak; or walk.There is no single test for MS.  Doctors use a medical history; physical exam; neurological exam; MRI; and other tests to diagnose it. There is no cure for MS; but medicines may slow it down and help control symptoms. Physical and occupational therapy may also help.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Autonomic Nervous System Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/autonomicnervoussystemdisorders.html,Your autonomic nervous system is the part of your nervous system that controls involuntary actions; such as the beating of your heart and the widening or narrowing of your blood vessels. When something goes wrong in this system; it can cause serious problems; including  Blood pressure problems Heart problems Trouble with breathing and swallowing Erectile dysfunction in men  Autonomic nervous system disorders can occur alone or as the result of another disease; such as Parkinson's disease; alcoholism and diabetes. Problems can affect either part of the system; as in complex regional pain syndromes; or all of the system. Some types are temporary; but many worsen over time. When they affect your breathing or heart function; these disorders can be life-threatening. Some autonomic nervous system disorders get better when an underlying disease is treated. Often; however; there is no cure. In that case; the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms.  NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Mumps,https://medlineplus.gov/mumps.html,Mumps is an illness caused by the mumps virus. It starts withFeverHeadacheMuscle achesTirednessLoss of appetiteAfter that; the salivary glands under the ears or jaw become swollen and tender. The swelling can be on one or both sides of the face.  Symptoms last 7 to 10 days. Serious complications are rare.You can catch mumps by being with another person who has it.  There is no treatment for mumps; but the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine can prevent it.Before the routine vaccination program in the United States; mumps was a common illness in infants; children and young adults. Now it is a rare disease in the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Muscle Cramps,https://medlineplus.gov/musclecramps.html,Muscle cramps are sudden; involuntary contractions or spasms in one or more of your muscles. They often occur after exercise or at night; lasting a few seconds to several minutes. It is a very common muscle problem.  Muscle cramps can be caused by nerves that malfunction. Sometimes this malfunction is due to a health problem; such as a spinal cord injury or a pinched nerve in the neck or back. Other causes are  Straining or overusing a muscle Dehydration A lack of minerals in your diet or the depletion of minerals in your body Not enough blood getting to your muscles  Cramps can be very painful. Stretching or gently massaging the muscle can relieve this pain.
Muscle Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/muscledisorders.html,Your muscles help you move and help your body work. Different types of muscles have different jobs. There are many problems that can affect muscles. Muscle disorders can cause weakness; pain or even paralysis. Causes of muscle disorders includeInjury or overuse; such as sprains or strains; cramps or tendinitis A genetic disorder; such as muscular dystrophySome cancersInflammation; such as myositisDiseases of nerves that affect musclesInfectionsCertain medicinesSometimes the cause is not known.
Sprains and Strains,https://medlineplus.gov/sprainsandstrains.html,A sprain is a stretched or torn ligament. Ligaments are tissues that connect bones at a joint. Falling; twisting; or getting hit can all cause a sprain. Ankle and wrist sprains are common. Symptoms include pain; swelling; bruising; and being unable to move your joint. You might feel a pop or tear when the injury happens. A strain is a stretched or torn muscle or tendon. Tendons are tissues that connect muscle to bone. Twisting or pulling these tissues can cause a strain. Strains can happen suddenly or develop over time. Back and hamstring muscle strains are common. Many people get strains playing sports. Symptoms include pain; muscle spasms; swelling; and trouble moving the muscle. At first; treatment of both sprains and strains usually involves resting the injured area; icing it; wearing a bandage or device that compresses the area; and medicines. Later treatment might include exercise and physical therapy. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Muscular Dystrophy,https://medlineplus.gov/musculardystrophy.html,Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of more than 30 inherited diseases. They all cause muscle weakness and muscle loss. Some forms of MD appear in infancy or childhood. Others may not appear until middle age or later. The different types can vary in whom they affect; which muscles they affect; and what the symptoms are. All forms of MD grow worse as the person's muscles get weaker. Most people with MD eventually lose the ability to walk.There is no cure for muscular dystrophy. Treatments can help with the symptoms and prevent complications. They include physical and speech therapy; orthopedic devices; surgery; and medications. Some people with MD have mild cases that worsen slowly. Others cases are disabling and severe.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Myasthenia Gravis,https://medlineplus.gov/myastheniagravis.html,Myasthenia gravis is a disease that causes weakness in your voluntary muscles. These are the muscles that you control. For example; you may have weakness in the muscles for eye movement; facial expressions; and swallowing. You can also have weakness in other muscles.  This weakness gets worse with activity; and better with rest.Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease. Your body's immune system makes antibodies that block or change some of the nerve signals to your muscles.  This makes your muscles weaker.Other conditions can cause muscle weakness; so myasthenia gravis can be hard to diagnose. Tests used to make a diagnosis include blood; nerve; muscle; and imaging tests.With treatment; the muscle weakness often gets much better. Medicines can help improve nerve-to-muscle messages and make muscles stronger. Other drugs keep your body from making so many abnormal antibodies. These medicines can have major side effects; so they should be used carefully. There are also treatments which filter abnormal antibodies from the blood or add healthy antibodies from donated blood. Sometimes; surgery to take out the thymus gland helps.Some people with myasthenia gravis go into remission. This means that they do not have symptoms.  The remission is usually temporary; but sometimes it can be permanent.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Mycobacterial Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/mycobacterialinfections.html,Mycobacteria are a type of germ. There are many different kinds. The most common one causes tuberculosis. Another one causes leprosy. Still others cause infections that are called atypical mycobacterial infections.  They aren't "typical" because they don't cause tuberculosis. But they can still harm people; especially people with other problems that affect their immunity; such as AIDS. Sometimes you can have these infections with no symptoms at all. At other times; they can cause lung symptoms similar to tuberculosis:  Cough Weight loss Coughing up blood or mucus Weakness or fatigue Fever and chills Night sweats Lack of appetite and weight loss  Medicines can treat these infections; but often more than one is needed to cure the infection.
Fungal Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/fungalinfections.html,If you have ever had athlete's foot or a yeast infection; you can blame a fungus. A fungus is a primitive organism. Mushrooms; mold and mildew are examples. Fungi live in air; in soil; on plants and in water. Some live in the human body. Only about half of all types of fungi are harmful.Some fungi reproduce through tiny spores in the air. You can inhale the spores or they can land on you. As a result; fungal infections often start in the lungs or on the skin. You are more likely to get a fungal infection if you have a weakened immune system or take antibiotics.Fungi can be difficult to kill. For skin and nail infections; you can apply medicine directly to the infected area. Oral antifungal medicines are also available for serious infections.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Myelodysplastic Syndromes,https://medlineplus.gov/myelodysplasticsyndromes.html,Your bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside some of your bones; such as your hip and thigh bones. It contains immature cells; called stem cells. The stem cells can develop into the red blood cells that carry oxygen through your body; the white blood cells that fight infections; and the platelets that help with blood clotting. If you have a myelodysplastic syndrome; the stem cells do not mature into healthy blood cells. Many of them die in the bone marrow.  This means that you do not have enough healthy cells; which can lead to infection; anemia; or easy bleeding.Myelodysplastic syndromes often do not cause early symptoms and are sometimes found during a routine blood test.  If you have symptoms; they may includeShortness of breathWeakness or feeling tiredSkin that is paler than usualEasy bruising or bleedingPinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleedingFever or frequent infectionsMyelodysplastic syndromes are rare. People at higher risk are over 60; have had chemotherapy or radiation therapy; or have been exposed to certain chemicals.  Treatment options include transfusions; drug therapy; chemotherapy; and blood or bone marrow stem cell transplants.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Spina Bifida,https://medlineplus.gov/spinabifida.html,Spina bifida is a neural tube defect - a type of birth defect of the brain; spine; or spinal cord. It happens if the spinal column of the fetus doesn't close completely during the first month of pregnancy. This can damage the nerves and spinal cord. Screening tests during pregnancy can check for spina bifida. Sometimes it is discovered only after the baby is born.The symptoms of spina bifida vary from person to person. Most people with spina bifida are of normal intelligence. Some people need assistive devices such as braces; crutches; or wheelchairs. They may have learning difficulties; urinary and bowel problems; or hydrocephalus; a buildup of fluid in the brain.The exact cause of spina bifida is unknown. It seems to run in families. Taking folic acid can reduce the risk of having a baby with spina bifida. It's in most multivitamins. Women who could become pregnant should take it daily.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Bone Marrow Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/bonemarrowdiseases.html,Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside some of your bones; such as your hip and thigh bones. It contains stem cells. The stem cells can develop into the red blood cells that carry oxygen through your body; the white blood cells that fight infections; and the platelets that help with blood clotting.With bone marrow disease; there are problems with the stem cells or how they develop:In leukemia; a cancer of the blood; the bone marrow makes abnormal white blood cellsIn aplastic anemia; the bone marrow doesn't make red blood cellsIn myeloproliferative disorders; the bone marrow makes too many white blood cellsOther diseases; such as lymphoma; can spread into the bone marrow and affect the production of blood cellsCauses of bone marrow diseases include genetics and environmental factors. Tests for bone marrow diseases include blood and bone marrow tests. Treatments depend on the disorder and how severe it is. They might involve medicines; blood transfusions or a bone marrow transplant.
Heart Attack,https://medlineplus.gov/heartattack.html,Each year almost 800;000 Americans have a heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart suddenly becomes blocked. Without the blood coming in; the heart can't get oxygen. If not treated quickly; the heart muscle begins to die. But if you do get quick treatment; you may be able prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. That's why it's important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 9-1-1 if you or someone else is having them. You should call; even if you are not sure that it is a heart attack.The most common symptoms in men and women areChest discomfort. It is often in center or left side of the chest. It usually lasts more than a few minutes. It may go away and come back. It can feel like pressure; squeezing; fullness; or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion.Shortness of breath. Sometimes this is your only symptom. You may get it before or during the chest discomfort. It can happen when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.Discomfort in the upper body. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms; the back; shoulders; neck; jaw; or upper part of the stomach.You may also have other symptoms; such as nausea; vomiting; dizziness; and lightheadedness. You may break out in a cold sweat. Sometimes women will have different symptoms then men. For example; they are more likely to feel tired for no reason.The most common cause of heart attacks is coronary artery disease (CAD). With CAD; there is a buildup of cholesterol and other material; called plaque; on their inner walls or the arteries. This is atherosclerosis. It can build up for years. Eventually an area of plaque can rupture (break open). A blood clot can form around the plaque and block the artery.A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery.At the hospital; health care providers make a diagnosis based on your symptoms; blood tests; and different heart health tests. Treatments may include medicines and medical procedures such as coronary angioplasty. After a heart attack; cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle changes can help you recover.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Muscle Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/muscledisorders.html,Your muscles help you move and help your body work. Different types of muscles have different jobs. There are many problems that can affect muscles. Muscle disorders can cause weakness; pain or even paralysis. Causes of muscle disorders includeInjury or overuse; such as sprains or strains; cramps or tendinitis A genetic disorder; such as muscular dystrophySome cancersInflammation; such as myositisDiseases of nerves that affect musclesInfectionsCertain medicinesSometimes the cause is not known.
Refractive Errors,https://medlineplus.gov/refractiveerrors.html,The cornea and lens of your eye helps you focus.  Refractive errors are vision problems that happen when the shape of the eye keeps you from focusing well. The cause could be the length of the eyeball (longer or shorter); changes in the shape of the cornea; or aging of the lens.Four common refractive errors areMyopia; or nearsightedness - clear vision close up but  blurry in the distanceHyperopia; or farsightedness - clear vision in the distance but blurry close upPresbyopia - inability to focus close up as a result of agingAstigmatism - focus problems caused by the corneaThe most common symptom is blurred vision. Other symptoms may include double vision; haziness; glare or halos around bright lights; squinting; headaches; or eye strain.Glasses or contact lenses can usually correct refractive errors. Laser eye surgery may also be a possibility.NIH: National Eye Institute
Myositis,https://medlineplus.gov/myositis.html,Myositis means inflammation of the muscles that you use to move your body. An injury; infection; or autoimmune disease can cause it. Two specific kinds are polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Polymyositis causes muscle weakness; usually in the muscles closest to the trunk of your body. Dermatomyositis causes muscle weakness; plus a skin rash.Other symptoms of myositis may includeFatigue after walking or standingTripping or fallingTrouble swallowing or breathingDoctors may use a physical exam; lab tests; imaging tests and a muscle biopsy to diagnose myositis. There is no cure for these diseases; but you can treat the symptoms. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are first treated with high doses of a corticosteroid. Other options include medications; physical therapy; exercise; heat therapy; assistive devices; and rest.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Nail Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/naildiseases.html,Your toenails and fingernails protect the tissues of your toes and fingers. They are made up of layers of a hardened protein called keratin; which is also in your hair and skin. The health of your nails can be a clue to your overall health. Healthy nails are usually smooth and consistent in color. Specific types of nail discoloration and changes in growth rate can be signs of lung; heart; kidney; and liver diseases; as well as diabetes and anemia. White spots and vertical ridges are harmless.Nail problems that sometimes require treatment includeBacterial and fungal infectionsIngrown nailsTumorsWartsKeeping your nails clean; dry; and trimmed can help you avoid some problems. Do not remove the cuticle; which can cause infection.
Personality Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/personalitydisorders.html,Personality disorders are a group of mental illnesses. They involve long-term patterns of thoughts and behaviors that are unhealthy and inflexible. The behaviors cause serious problems with relationships and work.  People with personality disorders have trouble dealing with everyday stresses and problems.  They often have stormy relationships with other people.The cause of personality disorders is unknown. However; genes and childhood experiences may play a role.The symptoms of each personality disorder are different. They can mild or severe.  People with personality disorders may have trouble realizing that they have a problem. To them; their thoughts are normal; and they often blame others for their problems. They may try to get help because of their problems with relationships and work.  Treatment usually includes talk therapy and sometimes medicine.
Sleep Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/sleepdisorders.html,Is it hard for you to fall asleep or stay asleep through the night? Do you wake up feeling tired or feel very sleepy during the day; even if you have had enough sleep? You might have a sleep disorder. The most common kinds areInsomnia - a hard time falling or staying asleepSleep apnea - breathing interruptions during sleep Restless legs syndrome - a tingling or prickly sensation in the legs Narcolepsy - daytime "sleep attacks"Nightmares; night terrors; sleepwalking; sleep talking; head banging; wetting the bed and grinding your teeth are kinds of sleep problems called parasomnias.  There are treatments for most sleep disorders.  Sometimes just having good sleep habits can help.
Drug Abuse,https://medlineplus.gov/drugabuse.html,Drug abuse is a serious public health problem that affects almost every community and family in some way. Each year drug abuse causes millions of serious illnesses or injuries among Americans.  Abused drugs includeMethamphetamineAnabolic steroidsClub drugsCocaineHeroinInhalantsMarijuanaPrescription drugs; including opioidsDrug abuse also plays a role in many major social problems; such as drugged driving; violence; stress; and child abuse. Drug abuse can lead to homelessness; crime; and missed work or problems with keeping a job. It harms unborn babies and destroys families. There are different types of treatment for drug abuse. But the best is to prevent drug abuse in the first place. NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Opioid Abuse and Addiction,https://medlineplus.gov/opioidabuseandaddiction.html,Opioids; sometimes called narcotics; are a type of drug. They include strong prescription pain relievers; such as oxycodone; hydrocodone; fentanyl; and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. Some opioids are made from the opium plant; and others are synthetic (man-made).A doctor may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer.  Some doctors prescribe them for chronic pain.Opioids can cause side effects such as drowsiness; mental fog; nausea; and constipation. They may also cause slowed breathing; which can lead to overdose deaths. If someone has signs of an overdose; call 9-1-1:The person's face is extremely pale and/or feels clammy to the touchTheir body goes limpTheir fingernails or lips have a purple or blue colorThey start vomiting or making gurgling noisesThey cannot be awakened or are unable to speakTheir breathing or heartbeat slows or stopsOther risks of using prescription opioids include dependence and addiction. Dependence means feeling withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that causes a person to compulsively seek out drugs; even though they cause harm. The risks of dependence and addiction are higher if you abuse the medicines. Abuse can include taking too much medicine; taking someone else's medicine; taking it in a different way than you are supposed to; or taking the medicine to get high.Opioid abuse; addiction; and overdoses are serious public health problems in the United States.  Another problem is that more women are abusing opioids during pregnancy. This can lead to babies being addicted and going through withdrawal; known as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Opioid abuse may sometimes also lead to heroin use; because some people switch from prescription opioids to heroin.The main treatment for prescription opioid addiction is medication-assisted treatment (MAT). It includes medicines; counseling; and support from family and friends. MAT can help you stop using the drug; get through withdrawal; and cope with cravings. There is also a medicine called naloxone which can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and prevent death; if it is given in time.To prevent problems with prescription opioids; be sure to follow your doctor's instructions when taking them. Do not share your medicines with anyone else. Contact your doctor if you have any concerns about taking the medicines.NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Pain Relievers,https://medlineplus.gov/painrelievers.html,Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve headaches; sore muscles; arthritis; or other aches and pains.  There are many different pain medicines; and each one has advantages and risks. Some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others. Each person may also have a slightly different response to a pain reliever. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are good for many types of pain. There are two main types of OTC pain medicines: acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin; naproxen (Aleve); and ibuprofen (Advil; Motrin) are examples of OTC NSAIDs.If OTC medicines don't relieve your pain; your doctor may prescribe something stronger. Many NSAIDs are also available at higher prescription doses. The most powerful pain relievers are opioids. They are very effective; but they can sometimes have serious side effects. There is also a risk of addiction. Because of the risks; you must use them only under a doctor's supervision.There are many things you can do to help ease pain. Pain relievers are just one part of a pain treatment plan.
Nasal Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/nasalcancer.html,Your paranasal sinuses are small hollow spaces around the nose. They are lined with cells that make mucus; which keeps your nose from drying out. The nasal cavity is the passageway just behind your nose. Air passes through it on the way to your throat as you breathe.Cancer of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses is rare.  You are at greater risk if you areMale and over 40 years oldExposed to certain workplace chemicalsInfected with HPVA smokerThere may be no symptoms at first; and later symptoms can be like those of infections. Doctors diagnose nasal cancer with imaging tests; lighted tube-like instruments that look inside the nose; and biopsies. Treatment options include surgery; radiation; and chemotherapy. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Nose Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/noseinjuriesanddisorders.html,Your nose is important to your health. It filters the air you breathe; removing dust; germs; and irritants. It warms and moistens the air to keep your lungs and tubes that lead to them from drying out. Your nose also contains the nerve cells that help your sense of smell. When there is a problem with your nose; your whole body can suffer. For example; the stuffy nose of the common cold can make it hard for you to breathe; sleep; or get comfortable. Many problems besides the common cold can affect the nose. They includeDeviated septum - a shifting of the wall that divides the nasal cavity into halvesNasal polyps - soft growths that develop on the lining of your nose or sinusesNosebleeds Rhinitis - inflammation of the nose and sinuses sometimes caused by allergies. The main symptom is a runny nose.Nasal fractures; also known as a broken nose
Throat Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/throatcancer.html,Throat cancer is a type of head and neck cancer. Throat cancer has different names; depending on which part of the throat is affected. The different parts of your throat are called the oropharynx; the hypopharynx; the nasopharynx; and the larynx; or voice box.The main risk factors for throat cancer are using tobacco heavy drinking. Certain types of throat cancer also have other risk factors. For example; having HPV is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer.Symptoms of throat cancer may includeA sore throat that does not go awayA lump in the neckPain or ringing in the earsTrouble swallowingEar painTo diagnose throat cancers; doctors may do a physical exam and history; imaging tests; and a biopsy. You may also need other tests; depending on the type of cancer. Treatments include surgery; radiation therapy; and chemotherapy. Treatment for some types of throat cancer may also include targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute

Earthquakes,https://medlineplus.gov/earthquakes.html,An earthquake happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another.  Earthquakes strike suddenly; violently; and without warning at any time of the day or night. If an earthquake occurs in a populated area; it may cause property damage; injuries; and even deaths. If you live in a coastal area; there is the possibility of a tsunami. Damage from earthquakes can also lead to floods or fires.Although there are no guarantees of safety during an earthquake; you can take actions to protect yourself.  You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear; anxiety; and losses. If you do experience a disaster; it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.Federal Emergency Management Agency
Floods,https://medlineplus.gov/floods.html,Floods are common in the United States.  Weather such as heavy rain; thunderstorms; hurricanes; or tsunamis can cause flooding.  Flooding can also happen when a river or stream overflows its bank; when a levee is breached; or when a dam breaks. Flash floods; which can develop quickly; often have a dangerous wall of roaring water.  The wall carries rocks; mud; and rubble and can sweep away most things in its path.Be aware of flood hazards no matter where you live; but especially if you live in a low-lying area; near water or downstream from a dam.  Although there are no guarantees of safety during a flood; you can take actions to protect yourself.  You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear; anxiety; and losses. If you do experience a disaster; it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.Federal Emergency Management Agency
Hurricanes,https://medlineplus.gov/hurricanes.html,A hurricane is a severe type of tropical storm. Hurricanes produce high winds; heavy rains and thunderstorms.   Hurricanes can cause tremendous damage. Winds can exceed 155 miles per hour. Hurricanes and tropical storms can also spawn tornadoes and lead to flooding. The high winds and heavy rains can destroy buildings; roads and bridges; and knock down power lines and trees. In coastal areas; very high tides called storm surges cause extensive damage.Although there are no guarantees of safety during a hurricane; you can take actions to protect yourself.

Tornadoes,https://medlineplus.gov/tornadoes.html,Tornadoes are nature's most violent storms. They are rotating; funnel-shaped clouds that extend from a thunderstorm to the ground. Their whirling winds can reach 300 miles per hour. They can strike quickly with little or no warning; devastate a neighborhood in seconds; and leave a path of damage over a mile wide and 50 miles long.  Tornadoes can also accompany tropical storms and hurricanes as they move onto land.Although there are no guarantees of safety during a tornado; you can take actions to protect yourself.  You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear; anxiety; and losses. If you do experience a disaster; it is normal to feel stressed.

Wildfires,https://medlineplus.gov/wildfires.html,Wildfires are fires that burn out of control in a natural area; like a forest; grassland; or prairie. They often begin unnoticed. They spread quickly; and can damage natural resources; destroy homes; and threaten the safety of the public and firefighters.Humans cause most wildfires. It can be an accident; like when people don't take care of their campfire properly; burn debris; or are careless when getting rid of their cigarettes. It can also be on purpose; which is called arson. Lightning and lava also can also causes wildfires. Wildfires are more common when conditions are dry. High winds can make them spread more quickly.Although there are no guarantees of safety if you live in an area threatened by a wildfire; you can take actions to protect yourself. You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear; anxiety; and losses. If you do experience a disaster; it is normal to feel stressed.

Nausea and Vomiting,https://medlineplus.gov/nauseaandvomiting.html,Nausea is an uneasy or unsettled feeling in the stomach together with an urge to vomit. Nausea and vomiting; or throwing up; are not diseases. They can be symptoms of many different conditions. These include morning sickness during pregnancy; infections; migraine headaches; motion sickness; food poisoning; cancer chemotherapy or other medicines.  For vomiting in children and adults; avoid solid foods until vomiting has stopped for at least six hours. Then work back to a normal diet. Drink small amounts of clear liquids to avoid dehydration. Nausea and vomiting are common. Usually; they are not serious. You should see a doctor immediately if you suspect poisoning or if you have  Vomited for longer than 24 hours  Blood in the vomit  Severe abdominal pain   Headache and stiff neck   Signs of dehydration; such as dry mouth; infrequent urination or dark urine
Refractive Errors,https://medlineplus.gov/refractiveerrors.html,The cornea and lens of your eye helps you focus.  Refractive errors are vision problems that happen when the shape of the eye keeps you from focusing well. The cause could be the length of the eyeball (longer or shorter); changes in the shape of the cornea; or aging of the lens.Four common refractive errors areMyopia; or nearsightedness - clear vision close up but  blurry in the distanceHyperopia; or farsightedness - clear vision in the distance but blurry close upPresbyopia - inability to focus close up as a result of agingAstigmatism - focus problems caused by the corneaThe most common symptom is blurred vision. Other symptoms may include double vision; haziness; glare or halos around bright lights; squinting; headaches; or eye strain.Glasses or contact lenses can usually correct refractive errors. Laser eye surgery may also be a possibility.NIH: National Eye Institute
Neck Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/neckinjuriesanddisorders.html,Any part of your neck - muscles; bones; joints; tendons; ligaments; or nerves - can cause neck problems. Neck pain is very common. Pain may also come from your shoulder; jaw; head; or upper arms. Muscle strain or tension often causes neck pain. The problem is usually overuse; such as from sitting at a computer for too long.  Sometimes you can strain your neck muscles from sleeping in an awkward position or overdoing it during exercise. Falls or accidents; including car accidents; are another common cause of neck pain.  Whiplash; a soft tissue injury to the neck; is also called neck sprain or strain.Treatment depends on the cause; but may include applying ice; taking pain relievers; getting physical therapy or wearing a cervical collar. You rarely need surgery.
Bacterial Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/bacterialinfections.html,Bacteria are living things that have only one cell.  Under a microscope; they look like balls; rods; or spirals. They are so small that a line of 1;000 could fit across a pencil eraser. Most bacteria won't hurt you - less than 1 percent of the different types make people sick. Many are helpful. Some bacteria help to digest food; destroy disease-causing cells; and give the body needed vitamins. Bacteria are also used in making healthy foods like yogurt and cheese.But infectious bacteria can make you ill. They reproduce quickly in your body. Many give off chemicals called toxins; which can damage tissue and make you sick. Examples of bacteria that cause infections include Streptococcus; Staphylococcus; and E. coli.Antibiotics are the usual treatment. When you take antibiotics; follow the directions carefully. Each time you take antibiotics; you increase the chances that bacteria in your body will learn to resist them causing antibiotic resistance. Later; you could get or spread an infection that those antibiotics cannot cure.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/cancer.html,Cancer begins in your cells; which are the building blocks of your body.   Normally; your body forms new cells as you need them; replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them; and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example; lung cancer starts in the lung; and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery; radiation and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy; immunotherapy or other types of biologic therapy; or stem cell transplantation. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Kidney Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/kidneydiseases.html,You have two kidneys; each about the size of your fist. They are near the middle of your back; just below the rib cage. Inside each kidney there are about a million tiny structures called nephrons. They filter your blood. They remove wastes and extra water; which become urine.  The urine flows through tubes called ureters. It goes to your bladder; which stores the urine until you go to the bathroom.Most kidney diseases attack the nephrons. This damage may leave kidneys unable to remove wastes. Causes can include genetic problems; injuries; or medicines. You have a higher risk of kidney disease if you have diabetes; high blood pressure; or a close family member with kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease damages the nephrons slowly over several years. Other kidney problems includeCancerCystsStonesInfectionsYour doctor can do blood and urine tests to check if you have kidney disease. If your kidneys fail; you will need dialysis or a kidney transplant.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Wilms Tumor,https://medlineplus.gov/wilmstumor.html,Wilms tumor is a rare type of kidney cancer. It causes a tumor on one or both kidneys. It usually affects children; but can happen in adults. Having certain genetic conditions or birth defects can increase the risk of getting it. Children that are at risk should be screened for Wilms tumor every three months until they turn eight.Symptoms include a lump in the abdomen; blood in the urine; and a fever for no reason. Tests that examine the kidney and blood are used to find the tumor.Doctors usually diagnose and remove the tumor in surgery. Other treatments include chemotherapy and radiation and biologic therapies. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Kidney Stones,https://medlineplus.gov/kidneystones.html,A kidney stone is a solid piece of material that forms in the kidney from substances in the urine. It may be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a pearl. Most kidney stones pass out of the body without help from a doctor. But sometimes a stone will not go away. It may get stuck in the urinary tract; block the flow of urine and cause great pain. The following may be signs of kidney stones that need a doctor's help:Extreme pain in your back or side that will not go awayBlood in your urineFever and chillsVomitingUrine that smells bad or looks cloudyA burning feeling when you urinateYour doctor will diagnose a kidney stone with urine; blood; and imaging tests.If you have a stone that won't pass on its own; you may need treatment. It can be done with shock waves; with a scope inserted through the tube that carries urine out of the body; called the urethra; or with surgery.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Neurologic Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/neurologicdiseases.html,The brain; spinal cord; and nerves make up the nervous system. Together they control all the workings of the body. When something goes wrong with a part of your nervous system; you can have trouble moving; speaking; swallowing; breathing; or learning.  You can also have problems with your memory; senses; or mood.There are more than 600 neurologic diseases. Major types include Diseases caused by faulty genes; such as Huntington's disease and muscular dystrophy Problems with the way the nervous system develops; such as spina bifida Degenerative diseases; where nerve cells are damaged or die; such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease Diseases of the  blood vessels that supply the brain; such as stroke Injuries to the spinal cord and brain Seizure disorders; such as epilepsy  Cancer; such as brain tumors infections; such as meningitis

Neural Tube Defects,https://medlineplus.gov/neuraltubedefects.html,Neural tube defects are birth defects of the brain; spine; or spinal cord. They happen in the first month of pregnancy; often before a woman even knows that she is pregnant. The two most common neural tube defects are spina bifida and anencephaly. In spina bifida; the fetal spinal column doesn't close completely. There is usually nerve damage that causes at least some paralysis of the legs. In anencephaly; most of the brain and skull do not develop. Babies with anencephaly are usually either stillborn or die shortly after birth. Another type of defect; Chiari malformation; causes the brain tissue to extend into the spinal canal.The exact causes of neural tube defects aren't known. You're at greater risk of having an infant with a neural tube defect if youHave obesityHave poorly controlled diabetesTake certain antiseizure medicinesGetting enough folic acid; a type of B vitamin; before and during pregnancy prevents most neural tube defects.Neural tube defects are usually diagnosed before the infant is born; through lab or imaging tests. There is no cure for neural tube defects. The nerve damage and loss of function that are present at birth are usually permanent. However; a variety of treatments can sometimes prevent further damage and help with complications.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Neuroblastoma,https://medlineplus.gov/neuroblastoma.html,Neuroblastoma is a cancer that forms in your nerve tissue. It usually begins in the adrenal glands; which sit atop your kidneys. It may also begin in your neck; chest or spinal cord.  The cancer often begins in early childhood. Sometimes it begins before a child is born. By the time doctors find the cancer; it has usually spread to other parts of the body.  The most common symptoms areA lump in the abdomen; neck or chestBulging eyesDark circles around the eyesBone painSwollen stomach and trouble breathing in babiesPainless; bluish lumps under the skin in babiesInability to move a body partTreatments include surgery; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; biologic therapy; or a combination. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer. Sometimes before giving treatment; doctors wait to see whether symptoms get worse. This is called watchful waiting.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Degenerative Nerve Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/degenerativenervediseases.html,Degenerative nerve diseases affect many of your body's activities; such as balance; movement; talking; breathing; and heart function.   Many of these diseases are genetic. Sometimes the cause is a medical condition such as alcoholism; a tumor; or a stroke. Other causes may include toxins; chemicals; and viruses.  Sometimes the cause is not known.Degenerative nerve diseases include Alzheimer's disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosisFriedreich's ataxia Huntington's disease Lewy body diseaseParkinson's disease  Spinal muscular atrophyDegenerative nerve diseases can be serious or life-threatening. It depends on the type. Most of them have no cure. Treatments may help improve symptoms; relieve pain; and increase mobility.
Neurofibromatosis,https://medlineplus.gov/neurofibromatosis.html,Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system. It mainly affects how nerve cells form and grow. It causes tumors to grow on nerves.  You can get neurofibromatosis from your parents; or it can happen because of a mutation (change) in your genes.  Once you have it; you can pass it along to your children. Usually the tumors are benign; but sometimes they can become cancerous.There are three types of neurofibromatosis: Type 1 (NF1) causes skin changes and deformed bones. It usually starts in childhood.  Sometimes the symptoms are present at birth.Type 2 (NF2) causes hearing loss; ringing in the ears; and poor balance. Symptoms often start in the teen years.Schwannomatosis causes intense pain. It is the rarest type.Doctors diagnose the different types based on the symptoms. Genetic testing is also used to diagnose NF1 and NF2. There is no cure. Treatment can help control symptoms. Depending on the type of disease and how serious it is; treatment may include surgery to remove tumors; radiation therapy; and medicines.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Bladder Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/bladderdiseases.html,The bladder is a hollow organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine. Many conditions can affect your bladder. Some common ones areCystitis - inflammation of the bladder; often from an infectionUrinary incontinence - loss of bladder controlOveractive bladder - a condition in which the bladder squeezes urine out at the wrong timeInterstitial cystitis - a chronic problem that causes bladder pain and frequent; urgent urinationBladder cancerDoctors diagnose bladder diseases using different tests. These include urine tests; x-rays; and an examination of the bladder wall with a scope called a cystoscope. Treatment depends on the cause of the problem. It may include medicines and; in severe cases; surgery. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Neurologic Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/neurologicdiseases.html,The brain; spinal cord; and nerves make up the nervous system. Together they control all the workings of the body.

Acoustic Neuroma,https://medlineplus.gov/acousticneuroma.html,An acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor that develops on the nerve that connects the ear to the brain. The tumor usually grows slowly. As it grows; it presses against the hearing and balance nerves. At first; you may have no symptoms or mild symptoms. They can include Loss of hearing on one side  Ringing in ears Dizziness and balance problemsThe tumor can also eventually cause numbness or paralysis of the face. If it grows large enough; it can press against the brain; becoming life-threatening.Acoustic neuroma can be difficult to diagnose; because the symptoms are similar to those of middle ear problems.  Ear exams; hearing tests; and scans can show if you have it.If the tumor stays small; you may only need to have it checked regularly.  If you do need treatment; surgery and radiation are options.If the tumors affect both hearing nerves; it is often because of a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders
Neuromuscular Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/neuromusculardisorders.html,Neuromuscular disorders affect the nerves that control your voluntary muscles. Voluntary muscles are the ones you can control; like in your arms and legs. Your nerve cells; also called neurons; send the messages that control these muscles. When the neurons become unhealthy or die; communication between your nervous system and muscles breaks down. As a result; your muscles weaken and waste away. The weakness can lead to twitching; cramps; aches and pains; and joint and movement problems. Sometimes it also affects heart function and your ability to breathe.Examples of neuromuscular disorders includeAmyotrophic lateral sclerosisMultiple sclerosisMyasthenia gravisSpinal muscular atrophyMany neuromuscular diseases are genetic; which means they run in families or there is a mutation in your genes. Sometimes; an immune system disorder can cause them. Most of them have no cure. The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms; increase mobility and lengthen life.
Diabetic Nerve Problems,https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticnerveproblems.html,If you have diabetes; your blood glucose; or blood sugar; levels are too high.  Over time; this can damage the covering on your nerves or the blood vessels that bring oxygen to your nerves. Damaged nerves may stop sending messages; or may send messages slowly or at the wrong times.  This damage is called diabetic neuropathy.  Over half of people with diabetes get it.  Symptoms may includeNumbness in your hands; legs; or feetShooting pains; burning; or tinglingNausea; vomiting; constipation; or diarrheaProblems with sexual functionUrinary problemsDizziness when you change positions quicklyYour doctor will diagnose diabetic neuropathy with a physical exam and nerve tests. Controlling your blood sugar can help prevent nerve problems; or keep them from getting worse. Treatment may include pain relief and other medicines.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Peripheral Nerve Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/peripheralnervedisorders.html,Your peripheral nerves are the ones outside your brain and spinal cord. Like static on a telephone line; peripheral nerve disorders distort or interrupt the messages between the brain and the rest of the body. There are more than 100 kinds of peripheral nerve disorders. They can affect one nerve or many nerves. Some are the result of other diseases; like diabetic nerve problems. Others; like Guillain-Barre syndrome; happen after a virus infection. Still others are from nerve compression; like carpal tunnel syndrome or thoracic outlet syndrome. In some cases; like complex regional pain syndrome and brachial plexus injuries; the problem begins after an injury. Some people are born with peripheral nerve disorders.Symptoms often start gradually; and then get worse. They include NumbnessPainBurning or tinglingMuscle weaknessSensitivity to touchTreatment aims to treat any underlying problem; reduce pain and control symptoms.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Birthmarks,https://medlineplus.gov/birthmarks.html,Birthmarks are abnormalities of the skin that are present when a baby is born. There are two types of birthmarks. Vascular birthmarks are made up of blood vessels that haven't formed correctly. They are usually red. Two types of vascular birthmarks are hemangiomas and port-wine stains.  Pigmented birthmarks are made of a cluster of pigment cells which cause color in skin. They can be many different colors; from tan to brown; gray to black; or even blue. Moles can be birthmarks.No one knows what causes many types of birthmarks; but some run in families. Your baby's doctor will look at the birthmark to see if it needs any treatment or if it should be watched. Pigmented birthmarks aren't usually treated; except for moles. Treatment for vascular birthmarks includes laser surgery. Most birthmarks are not serious; and some go away on their own. Some stay the same or get worse as you get older. Usually birthmarks are only a concern for your appearance. But certain types can increase your risk of skin cancer. If your birthmark bleeds; hurts; itches; or becomes infected; call your health care provider.
Moles,https://medlineplus.gov/moles.html,Moles are growths on the skin. They happen when pigment cells in the skin; called melanocytes; grow in clusters. Moles are very common. Most people have between 10 and 40 moles. A person may develop new moles from time to time; usually until about age 40. In older people; they tend to fade away.Moles are usually pink; tan or brown. They can be flat or raised. They are usually round or oval and no larger than a pencil eraser.About one out of every ten people has at least one unusual (or atypical) mole that looks different from an ordinary mole. They are called dysplastic nevi. They may be more likely than ordinary moles to develop into melanoma; a type of skin cancer. You should have a health care professional check your moles if they look unusual; grow larger; change in color or outline; or in any other way.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Newborn Screening,https://medlineplus.gov/newbornscreening.html,Your newborn infant has screening tests before leaving the hospital. There may be different tests depending on the state where you live. They includeTests on a few drops of blood from pricking the baby's heel. The tests look for inherited disorders. All states test for at least 30 of these conditions.A hearing test that measures the baby's response to soundA skin test that measures the level of oxygen in the blood. This can tell if the baby has a congenital heart defect.These tests look for serious medical conditions. If not treated; some of these conditions can cause lifelong health problems. Others can cause early death. With early diagnosis; treatment can begin right away; before serious problems can occur or become permanent.If a screening shows that your baby might have a condition; the health care provider or the state health department will call you. It is important to follow up quickly. Further testing can verify whether your baby has the condition. If so; treatment should start right away. NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
B Vitamins,https://medlineplus.gov/bvitamins.html,The B vitamins are  B1 (thiamine) B2 (riboflavin) B3 (niacin) B5 (pantothenic acid) B6 B7 (biotin) B12 Folic acid  These vitamins help the process your body uses to get or make energy from the food you eat. They also help form red blood cells.  You can get B vitamins from proteins such as fish; poultry; meat; eggs; and dairy products.  Leafy green vegetables; beans; and peas also have B vitamins.  Many cereals and some breads have added B vitamins. Not getting enough of certain B vitamins can cause diseases.  A lack of B12 or B6 can cause anemia.
Smoking,https://medlineplus.gov/smoking.html,There's no way around it. Smoking is bad for your health. Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body. Cigarette smoking causes 87 percent of lung cancer deaths. It is also responsible for many other cancers and health problems. These include lung disease; heart and blood vessel disease; stroke and cataracts. Women who smoke have a greater chance of certain pregnancy problems or having a baby die from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).  Your smoke is also bad for other people - they breathe in your smoke secondhand and can get many of the same problems as smokers do.E-cigarettes often look like cigarettes; but they work differently. They are battery-operated smoking devices. Not much is known about the health risks of using them.Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of health problems. The earlier you quit; the greater the benefit. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Genetic Brain Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/geneticbraindisorders.html,A genetic brain disorder is caused by a variation or a mutation in a gene.  A variation is a different form of a gene. A mutation is a change in a gene. Genetic brain disorders affect the development and function of the brain.Some genetic brain disorders are due to random gene mutations or mutations caused by environmental exposure; such as cigarette smoke. Other disorders are inherited; which means that a mutated gene or group of genes is passed down through a family. They can also be due to a combination of both genetic changes and other outside factors.Some examples of genetic brain disorders includeLeukodystrophiesPhenylketonuriaTay-Sachs diseaseWilson diseaseMany people with genetic brain disorders fail to produce enough of certain proteins that influence brain development and function. These brain disorders can cause serious problems that affect the nervous system. Some have treatments to control symptoms.  Some are life-threatening.
Sleep Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/sleepdisorders.html,Is it hard for you to fall asleep or stay asleep through the night? Do you wake up feeling tired or feel very sleepy during the day; even if you have had enough sleep? You might have a sleep disorder. The most common kinds areInsomnia - a hard time falling or staying asleepSleep apnea - breathing interruptions during sleep Restless legs syndrome - a tingling or prickly sensation in the legs Narcolepsy - daytime "sleep attacks"Nightmares; night terrors; sleepwalking; sleep talking; head banging; wetting the bed and grinding your teeth are kinds of sleep problems called parasomnias.  There are treatments for most sleep disorders.  Sometimes just having good sleep habits can help.
Bedwetting,https://medlineplus.gov/bedwetting.html,Many children wet the bed until they are 5 or even older. A child's bladder might be too small. Or the amount of urine produced overnight can be more than the bladder can hold. Some children sleep too deeply or take longer to learn bladder control. Stress can also be a factor. Children should not be punished for wetting the bed. They don't do it on purpose; and most outgrow it.Call the doctor if your child is 7 years old or older and wets the bed more than two or three times in a week. The doctor will look for and treat any other heath problems that could cause the bedwetting. Bedwetting alarms; bladder training; and medicines might help with the bedwetting.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Noise,https://medlineplus.gov/noise.html,Noise is all around you; from televisions and radios to lawn mowers and washing machines.  Normally; you hear these sounds at safe levels that don't affect hearing. But sounds that are too loud or loud sounds over a long time are harmful.  They can damage sensitive structures of the inner ear and cause noise-induced hearing loss.More than 30 million Americans are exposed to hazardous sound levels on a regular basis.  Hazardous sound levels are louder than 80 decibels. That's not as loud as traffic on a busy street. Listening to loud music; especially on headphones; is a common cause of noise-induced hearing loss.  You can protect your hearing byKeeping the volume down when listening to musicWearing earplugs when using loud equipmentNIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Lymphoma,https://medlineplus.gov/lymphoma.html,Lymphoma is a cancer of a part of the immune system called the lymph system.  There are many types of lymphoma.  One type is Hodgkin disease.  The rest are called non-Hodgkin lymphomas.Non-Hodgkin lymphomas begin when a type of white blood cell; called a T cell or B cell; becomes abnormal. The cell divides again and again; making more and more abnormal cells. These abnormal cells can spread to almost any other part of the body. Most of the time; doctors don't know why a person gets non-Hodgkin lymphoma. You are at increased risk if you have a weakened immune system or have certain types of infections.Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can cause many symptoms; such as Swollen; painless lymph nodes in the neck; armpits or groinUnexplained weight loss Fever Soaking night sweats Coughing; trouble breathing or chest pain Weakness and tiredness that don't go away Pain; swelling or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen Your doctor will diagnose lymphoma with a physical exam; blood tests; a chest x-ray; and a biopsy.  Treatments include chemotherapy; radiation therapy; targeted therapy; biological therapy; or therapy to remove proteins from the blood. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.  Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer. If you don't have symptoms; you may not need treatment right away. This is called watchful waiting.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Diabetes Type 2,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype2.html,Diabetes means your blood glucose; or blood sugar; levels are too high.  With type 2 diabetes; the more common type; your body does not make or use insulin well. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin; too much glucose stays in your blood.  Over time; high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart; eyes; kidneys; nerves; and gums and teeth.You have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if you are older; have obesity; have a family history of diabetes; or do not exercise. Having prediabetes also increases your risk.  Prediabetes means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. If you are at risk for type 2 diabetes; you may be able to delay or prevent developing it by making some lifestyle changes.The symptoms of type 2 diabetes appear slowly.  Some people do not notice symptoms at all.  The symptoms can includeBeing very thirstyUrinating oftenFeeling very hungry or tiredLosing weight without tryingHaving sores that heal slowlyHaving blurry eyesightBlood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test; the A1C; can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Many people can manage their diabetes through healthy eating; physical activity; and blood glucose testing.  Some people also need to take diabetes medicines.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Over-the-Counter Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/overthecountermedicines.html,Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are drugs you can buy without a prescription. Some OTC medicines relieve aches; pains and itches. Some prevent or cure diseases; like tooth decay and athlete's foot. Others help manage recurring problems; like migraines.  In the United States; the Food and Drug Administration decides whether a medicine is safe enough to sell over-the-counter.  Taking OTC medicines still has risks. Some interact with other medicines; supplements; foods or drinks. Others cause problems for people with certain medical conditions. If you're pregnant; talk to your health care provider before taking any medicines. It is important to take medicines correctly; and be careful when giving them to children. More medicine does not necessarily mean better. You should never take OTC medicines longer or in higher doses than the label recommends. If your symptoms don't go away; it's a clear signal that it's time to see your health care provider. Food and Drug Administration
Lung Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/lungcancer.html,Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. It is a leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States. Cigarette smoking causes most lung cancers. The more cigarettes you smoke per day and the earlier you started smoking; the greater your risk of lung cancer. High levels of pollution; radiation and asbestos exposure may also increase risk. Common symptoms of lung cancer includeA cough that doesn't go away and gets worse over timeConstant chest painCoughing up bloodShortness of breath; wheezing; or hoarsenessRepeated problems with pneumonia or bronchitisSwelling of the neck and faceLoss of appetite or weight lossFatigueDoctors diagnose lung cancer using a physical exam; imaging; and lab tests. Treatment depends on the type; stage; and how advanced it is. Treatments include surgery; chemotherapy; radiation therapy; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Fatty Liver Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/fattyliverdisease.html,What is fatty liver disease?Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food; store energy; and remove poisons. Fatty liver disease is a condition in which fat builds up in your liver. There are two main types:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)Alcoholic fatty liver disease; also called alcoholic steatohepatitisWhat is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)?NAFLD is a type of fatty liver disease that is not related to heavy alcohol use. There are two kinds:Simple fatty liver; in which you have fat in your liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Simple fatty liver typically does not get bad enough to cause liver damage or complications.Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage; as well as fat in your liver. Inflammation and liver cell damage can cause fibrosis; or scarring; of the liver. NASH may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.What is alcoholic fatty liver disease?Alcoholic fatty liver disease is due to heavy alcohol use. Your liver breaks down most of the alcohol you drink; so it can be removed from your body. But the process of breaking it down can generate harmful substances. These substances can damage liver cells; promote inflammation; and weaken your body's natural defenses. The more alcohol that you drink; the more you damage your liver.  Alcoholic fatty liver disease is the earliest stage of alcohol-related liver disease. The next stages are alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.Who gets fatty liver disease?Researchers do not know the cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). They do know that it is more common in people whoHave type 2 diabetes and prediabetesHave obesityAre middle aged or older (although children can also get it)Are Hispanic; followed by non-Hispanic whites. It is less common in African Americans.Have high levels of fats in the blood; such as cholesterol and triglyceridesHave high blood pressureTake certain drugs; such as corticosteroids and some cancer drugsHave certain metabolic disorders; including metabolic syndromeHave rapid weight lossHave certain infections; such as hepatitis CHave been exposed to some toxinsNAFLD affects about 25 percent of people in the world. As the rates of obesity; type 2 diabetes; and high cholesterol are rising in the United States; so is the rate of NAFLD. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disorder in the United States.Alcoholic fatty liver disease only happens in people who are heavy drinkers; especially those who have been drinking for a long period of time. The risk is higher for heavy drinkers who are women; have obesity; or have certain genetic mutations.What are the symptoms of fatty liver disease?Both NAFLD and alcoholic fatty liver disease are usually silent diseases with few or no symptoms. If you do have symptoms; you may feel tired or have discomfort in the upper right side of your abdomen.How do I know if I have fatty liver disease?Because there are often no symptoms; it is not easy to find fatty liver disease. Your doctor may suspect that you have it if you get abnormal results on liver tests that you had for other reasons. To make a diagnosis; your doctor will useYour medical historyA physical examVarious tests; including blood and imaging tests; and sometimes a biopsyAs part of the medical history; your doctor will ask about your alcohol use; to find out whether fat in your liver is a sign of alcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). He or she will also ask which medicines you take; to try to determine whether a medicine is causing your NAFLD.During the physical exam; your doctor will examine your body and check your weight and height. Your doctor will look for signs of fatty liver disease; such asAn enlarged liverSigns of cirrhosis; such as jaundice; a condition that causes your skin and whites of your eyes to turn yellowYou will likely have blood tests; including liver function tests and blood count tests. In some cases you may also have imaging tests; like those that check for fat in the liver and the stiffness of your liver. Liver stiffness can mean fibrosis; which is scarring of the liver. In some cases you may also need a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis; and to check how bad the liver damage is.What are the treatments for fatty liver disease?Doctors recommend weight loss for nonalcoholic fatty liver. Weight loss can reduce fat in the liver; inflammation; and fibrosis. If your doctor thinks that a certain medicine is the cause of your NAFLD; you should stop taking that medicine.  But check with your doctor before stopping the medicine. You may need to get off the medicine gradually; and you might need to switch to another medicine instead.There are no medicines that have been approved to treat NAFLD. Studies are investigating whether a certain diabetes medicine or Vitamin E can help; but more studies are needed.The most important part of treating alcohol-related fatty liver disease is to stop drinking alcohol. If you need help doing that; you may want to see a therapist or participate in an alcohol recovery program. There are also medicines that can help; either by reducing your cravings or making you feel sick if you drink alcohol.Both alcoholic fatty liver disease and one type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) can lead to cirrhosis. Doctors can treat the health problems caused by cirrhosis with medicines; operations; and other medical procedures. If the cirrhosis leads to liver failure; you may need a liver transplant.What are some lifestyle changes that can help with fatty liver disease?If you have any of the types of fatty liver disease; there are some lifestyle changes that can help:Eat a healthy diet; limiting salt and sugar; plus eating lots of fruits; vegetables; and whole grainsGet vaccinations for hepatitis A and B; the flu and pneumococcal disease. If you get hepatitis A or B along with fatty liver; it is more likely to lead to liver failure. People with chronic liver disease are more likely to get infections; so the other two vaccinations are also important.Get regular exercise; which can help you lose weight and reduce fat in the liverTalk with your doctor before using dietary supplements; such as vitamins; or any complementary or alternative medicines or medical practices. Some herbal remedies can damage your liver.
Celiac Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/celiacdisease.html,Celiac disease is an immune disease in which people can't eat gluten because it will damage their small intestine. If you have celiac disease and eat foods with gluten; your immune system responds by damaging the small intestine.  Gluten is a protein found in wheat; rye; and barley. It may also be in other products like vitamins and supplements; hair and skin products; toothpastes; and lip balm.Celiac disease affects each person differently. Symptoms may occur in the digestive system; or in other parts of the body. One person might have diarrhea and abdominal pain; while another person may be irritable or depressed. Irritability is one of the most common symptoms in children. Some people have no symptoms.Celiac disease is genetic. Blood tests can help your doctor diagnose the disease. Your doctor may also need to examine a small piece of tissue from your small intestine. Treatment is a diet free of gluten. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Norovirus Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/norovirusinfections.html,Noroviruses are a group of related viruses. Infection with these viruses causes an illness called gastroenteritis; an inflammation of the stomach and intestines.  It can spread from person to person; or through contaminated food or water.  You can also get it if you touch a contaminated surface. Norovirus can be serious; especially for young children and older adults.The most common symptoms of norovirus infection areDiarrheaNausea and vomitingStomach painOther symptoms may include fever; headache or body aches.Treatment includes bed rest and lots of liquids to prevent dehydration.

Nuclear Scans,https://medlineplus.gov/nuclearscans.html,Nuclear scans use radioactive substances to see structures and functions inside your body. They use a special camera that detects radioactivity.Before the test; you receive a small amount of radioactive material. You may get it as an injection. Sometimes you swallow it or inhale it.   Then you lie still on a table while the camera makes images. Most scans take 20 to 45 minutes.Nuclear scans can help doctors diagnose many conditions; including cancers; injuries; and infections. They can also show how organs like your heart and lungs are working.
Nursing Homes,https://medlineplus.gov/nursinghomes.html,A nursing home is a place for people who don't need to be in a hospital but can't be cared for at home. Most nursing homes have nursing aides and skilled nurses on hand 24 hours a day.  Some nursing homes are set up like a hospital. The staff provides medical care; as well as physical; speech and occupational therapy. There might be a nurses' station on each floor. Other nursing homes try to be more like home. They try to have a neighborhood feel. Often; they don't have a fixed day-to-day schedule; and kitchens might be open to residents. Staff members are encouraged to develop relationships with residents. Some nursing homes have special care units for people with serious memory problems such as Alzheimer's disease. Some will let couples live together. Nursing homes are not only for the elderly; but for anyone who requires 24-hour care. NIH: National Institute on Aging
Food Allergy,https://medlineplus.gov/foodallergy.html,Food allergy is an abnormal response to a food triggered by your body's immune system.In adults; the foods that most often trigger allergic reactions include fish; shellfish; peanuts; and tree nuts; such as walnuts. Problem foods for children can include eggs; milk; peanuts; tree nuts; soy; and wheat.The allergic reaction may be mild. In rare cases it can cause a severe reaction called anaphylaxis. Symptoms of food allergy includeItching or swelling in your mouthVomiting; diarrhea; or abdominal cramps and painHives or eczemaTightening of the throat and trouble breathingDrop in blood pressureYour health care provider may use a detailed history; elimination diet; and skin and blood tests to diagnose a food allergy.When you have food allergies; you must be prepared to treat an accidental exposure. Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace; and carry an auto-injector device containing epinephrine (adrenaline).You can only prevent the symptoms of food allergy by avoiding the food. After you and your health care provider have identified the foods to which you are sensitive; you must remove them from your diet.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Nutrition,https://medlineplus.gov/nutrition.html,Food provides the energy and nutrients you need to be healthy. Nutrients include proteins; carbohydrates; fats; vitamins; minerals; and water.

The key is toEat a variety of foods; including vegetables; fruits; and whole-grain productsEat lean meats; poultry; fish; beans; and low-fat dairy products Drink lots of waterLimit salt; sugar; alcohol; saturated fat; and trans fat in your dietSaturated fats are usually fats that come from animals. Look for trans fat on the labels of processed foods; margarines; and shortenings.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Pregnancy and Nutrition,https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancyandnutrition.html,When you're pregnant; eating healthy foods is more important than ever. You need more protein; iron; calcium; and folic acid than you did before pregnancy. You also need more calories. But "eating for two" doesn't mean eating twice as much. It means that the foods you eat are the main source of nutrients for your baby. Sensible; balanced meals will be best for you and your baby.You should gain weight gradually during your pregnancy; with most of the weight gained in the last trimester. Generally; doctors suggest women gain weight at the following rate:2 to 4 pounds total during the first trimester3 to 4 pounds per month for the second and third trimestersMost women need 300 calories a day or more during at least the last six months of pregnancy than they did before they were pregnant. But not all calories are equal. Your baby needs healthy foods that are packed with nutrients - not "empty calories" such as those found in soft drinks; candies; and desserts.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Nutrition for Seniors,https://medlineplus.gov/nutritionforseniors.html,Food provides the energy and nutrients you need to be healthy. Nutrients include proteins; carbohydrates; fats; vitamins; minerals and water.  Studies show that a good diet in your later years reduces your risk of osteoporosis; high blood pressure; heart diseases and certain cancers. As you age; you might need less energy. But you still need just as many of the nutrients in food. To get them  Choose a variety of healthy foods Avoid empty calories; which are foods with lots of calories but few nutrients; such as chips; cookies; soda and alcohol Pick foods that are low in cholesterol and fat; especially saturated and trans fats   Saturated fats are usually fats that come from animals. Look for trans fat on the labels of processed foods; margarines and shortenings. NIH: National Institute on Aging
Food Labeling,https://medlineplus.gov/foodlabeling.html,Most packaged foods in the U.S. have food labels.  On every food label you will seeServing size; number of servings; and number of calories per serving Information on the amount of dietary fat; cholesterol; dietary fiber; dietary sodium; carbohydrates; dietary proteins; vitamins; and minerals in each serving  Definitions for terms such as low-fat and high-fiber Information to help you see how a food fits into an overall daily diet Food and Drug Administration
Child Nutrition,https://medlineplus.gov/childnutrition.html,A healthy diet helps children grow and learn. It also helps prevent obesity and weight-related diseases; such as diabetes. To give your child a nutritious dietMake half of what is on your child's plate fruits and vegetablesChoose healthy sources of protein; such as lean meat; nuts; and eggsServe whole-grain breads and cereals because they are high in fiber. Reduce refined grains.Broil; grill; or steam foods instead of frying themLimit fast food and junk foodOffer water or milk instead of sugary fruit drinks and sodasLearn about your children's nutrient requirements. Some of them; such as the requirements for iron and calcium; change as your child ages. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Eye Movement Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eyemovementdisorders.html,When you look at an object; you're using several muscles to move both eyes to focus on it. If you have a problem with the muscles; the eyes don't work properly.There are many kinds of eye movement disorders. Two common ones areStrabismus - a disorder in which the two eyes don't line up in the same direction. This results in "crossed eyes" or "walleye."Nystagmus - fast; uncontrollable movements of the eyes; sometimes called "dancing eyes"Some eye movement disorders are present at birth. Others develop over time and may be associated with other problems; such as injuries. Treatments include glasses; patches; eye muscle exercises; and surgery. There is no cure for some kinds of eye movement disorders; such as most kinds of nystagmus.
Obesity,https://medlineplus.gov/obesity.html,Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight; which means weighing too much.  The weight may come from muscle; bone; fat; and/or body water.  Both terms mean that a person's weight is greater than what's considered healthy for his or her height. Obesity happens over time when you eat more calories than you use. The balance between calories-in and calories-out differs for each person. Factors that might affect your weight include your genetic makeup; overeating; eating high-fat foods; and not being physically active. Obesity increases your risk of diabetes; heart disease; stroke; arthritis; and some cancers. If you have obesity; losing even 5 to 10 percent of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases. For example; that means losing 10 to 20 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Obesity in Children,https://medlineplus.gov/obesityinchildren.html,Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight; which means weighing too much. Both terms mean that a person's weight is greater than what's considered healthy for his or her height.  Children grow at different rates; so it isn't always easy to know when a child has obesity or is overweight. Ask your health care provider to check whether your child's weight and height are in a healthy range.If a weight-loss program is necessary; involve the whole family in healthy habits so your child doesn't feel singled out.  Encourage healthy eating byServing more fruits and vegetablesBuying fewer soft drinks and high-fat; high-calorie snack foodsMaking sure your child eats breakfast every dayEating fast food less oftenNot using food as a rewardPhysical activity is also very important. Kids need about 60 minutes each day. It does not have to happen all at once. Several short periods of activity during the day are just as good.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Weight Loss Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/weightlosssurgery.html,Weight loss surgery helps people with extreme obesity to lose weight. It may be an option if you cannot lose weight through diet and exercise or have serious health problems caused by obesity.There are different types of weight loss surgery.  They often limit the amount of food you can take in. Some types of surgery also affect how you digest food and absorb nutrients. All types have risks and complications; such as infections; hernias; and blood clots.Many people who have the surgery lose weight quickly; but regain some weight later on.  If you follow diet and exercise recommendations; you can keep most of the weight off. You will also need medical follow-up for the rest of your life.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

If you have OCD; you have frequent; upsetting thoughts called obsessions.  To try to control the thoughts; you feel an overwhelming urge to repeat certain rituals or behaviors. These are called compulsions.Examples of obsessions are a fear of germs or a fear of being hurt.  Compulsions include washing your hands; counting; checking on things; or cleaning. With OCD; the thoughts and rituals cause distress and get in the way of your daily life.Researchers think brain circuits may not work properly in people who have OCD. It tends to run in families. The symptoms often begin in children or teens. Treatments include therapy; medicines; or both. One type of therapy; cognitive behavioral therapy; is useful for treating OCD.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health

Rehabilitation often focuses on  Physical therapy to help your strength; mobility and fitness Occupational therapy to help you with your daily activities  Speech-language therapy to help with speaking; understanding; reading; writing and swallowing Treatment of pain  The type of therapy and goals of therapy may be different for different people. An older person who has had a stroke may simply want rehabilitation to be able to dress or bathe without help. A younger person who has had a heart attack may go through cardiac rehabilitation to try  to return to work and normal activities. Someone with a lung disease may get pulmonary rehabilitation to be able to breathe better and improve their quality of life.

Oil Spills,https://medlineplus.gov/oilspills.html,Oil spills often happen because of accidents; when people make mistakes or equipment breaks down. Other causes include natural disasters or deliberate acts.  Oil spills have major environmental and economic effects.Oil spills can also affect human health. These effects can depend on what kind of oil was spilled and where (on land; in a river; or in the ocean). Other factors include what kind of exposure and how much exposure there was. People who clean up the spill are more at risk. Problems could include skin and eye irritation; neurologic and breathing problems; and stress. Not much is known about the long-term effects of oil spills.
Patient Rights,https://medlineplus.gov/patientrights.html,As a patient; you have certain rights.  Some are guaranteed by federal law; such as the right to get a copy of your medical records; and the right to keep them private.  Many states have additional laws protecting patients; and health care facilities often have a patient bill of rights.An important patient right is informed consent.  This means that if you need a treatment; your health care provider must give you the information you need to make a decision.Many hospitals have patient advocates who can help you if you have problems. Many states have an ombudsman office for problems with long term care.  Your state's department of health may also be able to help.
Dietary Fats,https://medlineplus.gov/dietaryfats.html,Fat is a type of nutrient. You need some fat in your diet but not too much. Fats give you energy and help your body absorb vitamins. Dietary fat also plays a major role in your cholesterol levels.But not all fats are the same. You should try to avoidSaturated fats such as butter; solid shortening; and lardTrans fats. These are found in vegetable shortenings; some margarines; crackers; cookies; snack foods; and other foods made with or fried in partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs). By 2018; most U.S. companies will not be allowed to add PHOs to food.Try to replace them with oils such as canola; olive; safflower; sesame; or sunflower. Of course; eating too much fat will put on the pounds.  Fat has twice as many calories as proteins or carbohydrates.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/cancer.html,Cancer begins in your cells; which are the building blocks of your body.   Normally; your body forms new cells as you need them; replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them; and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example; lung cancer starts in the lung; and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery; radiation and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy; immunotherapy or other types of biologic therapy; or stem cell transplantation. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Nail Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/naildiseases.html,Your toenails and fingernails protect the tissues of your toes and fingers. They are made up of layers of a hardened protein called keratin; which is also in your hair and skin. The health of your nails can be a clue to your overall health. Healthy nails are usually smooth and consistent in color. Specific types of nail discoloration and changes in growth rate can be signs of lung; heart; kidney; and liver diseases; as well as diabetes and anemia. White spots and vertical ridges are harmless.Nail problems that sometimes require treatment includeBacterial and fungal infectionsIngrown nailsTumorsWartsKeeping your nails clean; dry; and trimmed can help you avoid some problems. Do not remove the cuticle; which can cause infection.
Heart Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/heartsurgery.html,Heart surgery can correct problems with the heart if other treatments haven't worked or can't be used. The most common type of heart surgery for adults is coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). During CABG; a healthy artery or vein from the body is connected; or grafted; to a blocked coronary (heart) artery.Doctors also use heart surgery toRepair or replace heart valves; which control blood flow through the heartRepair abnormal or damaged structures in the heartImplant medical devices that help control the heartbeat or support heart function and blood flowReplace a damaged heart with a healthy heart from a donorTreat heart failure and coronary heart disease Control abnormal heart rhythmsHeart surgery has risks; even though its results often are excellent. Risks include bleeding; infection; irregular heartbeats; and stroke. The risk is higher if you are older or a woman. The risk is also higher if you have other diseases or conditions; such as diabetes; kidney disease; lung disease; or peripheral arterial disease.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Spina Bifida,https://medlineplus.gov/spinabifida.html,Spina bifida is a neural tube defect - a type of birth defect of the brain; spine; or spinal cord. It happens if the spinal column of the fetus doesn't close completely during the first month of pregnancy. This can damage the nerves and spinal cord. Screening tests during pregnancy can check for spina bifida. Sometimes it is discovered only after the baby is born.The symptoms of spina bifida vary from person to person. Most people with spina bifida are of normal intelligence. Some people need assistive devices such as braces; crutches; or wheelchairs. They may have learning difficulties; urinary and bowel problems; or hydrocephalus; a buildup of fluid in the brain.The exact cause of spina bifida is unknown. It seems to run in families. Taking folic acid can reduce the risk of having a baby with spina bifida. It's in most multivitamins. Women who could become pregnant should take it daily.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/surgery.html,There are many reasons to have surgery. Some operations can relieve or prevent pain. Others can reduce a symptom of a problem or improve some body function. Some surgeries are done to find a problem. For example; a surgeon may do a biopsy; which involves removing a piece of tissue to examine under a microscope. Some surgeries; like heart surgery; can save your life.Some operations that once needed large incisions (cuts in the body) can now be done using much smaller cuts. This is called laparoscopic surgery. Surgeons insert a thin tube with a camera to see; and use small tools to do the surgery.After surgery there can be a risk of complications; including infection; too much bleeding; reaction to anesthesia; or accidental injury. There is almost always some pain with surgery.Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
Eye Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/eyediseases.html,Some eye problems are minor and don't last long. But some can lead to a permanent loss of vision.Common eye problems includeRefractive errorsCataracts - clouded lensesOptic nerve disorders; including glaucomaRetinal disorders - problems with the nerve layer at the back of the eyeMacular degeneration - a disease that destroys sharp; central visionDiabetic eye problemsConjunctivitis - an  infection also known as pinkeyeYour best defense is to have regular checkups; because eye diseases do not always have symptoms. Early detection and treatment could prevent vision loss. See an eye care professional right away if you have a sudden change in vision; if everything looks dim; or if you see flashes of light. Other symptoms that need quick attention are pain; double vision; fluid coming from the eye; and inflammation.NIH: National Eye Institute
Heroin,https://medlineplus.gov/heroin.html,Heroin is a white or brown powder or a black; sticky goo. It's  an opioid drug made from morphine; a natural substance in the seedpod of the Asian poppy plant. It can be mixed with water and injected with a needle. Heroin can also be smoked or snorted up the nose. All of these ways of taking heroin send it to the brain very quickly.  This makes it very addictive.Major health problems from heroin include miscarriages; heart infections; and death from overdose. People who inject the drug also risk getting infectious diseases; including HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.Regular use of heroin can lead to tolerance. This means users need more and more drug to have the same effect. At higher doses over time; the body becomes dependent on heroin. If dependent users stop heroin; they have withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms include restlessness; muscle and bone pain; diarrhea and vomiting; and cold flashes with goose bumps. NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Opioid Abuse and Addiction,https://medlineplus.gov/opioidabuseandaddiction.html,Opioids; sometimes called narcotics; are a type of drug. They include strong prescription pain relievers; such as oxycodone; hydrocodone; fentanyl; and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. Some opioids are made from the opium plant; and others are synthetic (man-made).A doctor may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer.  Some doctors prescribe them for chronic pain.Opioids can cause side effects such as drowsiness; mental fog; nausea; and constipation. They may also cause slowed breathing; which can lead to overdose deaths. If someone has signs of an overdose; call 9-1-1:The person's face is extremely pale and/or feels clammy to the touchTheir body goes limpTheir fingernails or lips have a purple or blue colorThey start vomiting or making gurgling noisesThey cannot be awakened or are unable to speakTheir breathing or heartbeat slows or stopsOther risks of using prescription opioids include dependence and addiction. Dependence means feeling withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that causes a person to compulsively seek out drugs; even though they cause harm. The risks of dependence and addiction are higher if you abuse the medicines. Abuse can include taking too much medicine; taking someone else's medicine; taking it in a different way than you are supposed to; or taking the medicine to get high.Opioid abuse; addiction; and overdoses are serious public health problems in the United States.  Another problem is that more women are abusing opioids during pregnancy. This can lead to babies being addicted and going through withdrawal; known as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Opioid abuse may sometimes also lead to heroin use; because some people switch from prescription opioids to heroin.The main treatment for prescription opioid addiction is medication-assisted treatment (MAT). It includes medicines; counseling; and support from family and friends. MAT can help you stop using the drug; get through withdrawal; and cope with cravings. There is also a medicine called naloxone which can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and prevent death; if it is given in time.To prevent problems with prescription opioids; be sure to follow your doctor's instructions when taking them. Do not share your medicines with anyone else. Contact your doctor if you have any concerns about taking the medicines.NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse

HIV/AIDS and Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaidsandinfections.html,Having HIV/AIDS weakens your body's immune system. It destroys the white blood cells that fight infection. This puts you at risk for opportunistic infections (OIs). OIs are serious infections that take advantage of your weak immune system. These infections are less common and less severe in healthy people.There are many types of OIs:Bacterial infections; including tuberculosis and a serious related disease; Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)Viral infections; such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis CFungal infections; like yeast infections; cryptococcal meningitis; pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and histoplasmosisParasitic infections; such as crypto (cryptosporidiosis) and toxo (toxoplasmosis)Having HIV/AIDS can make infections harder to treat. People with HIV/AIDS are also more likely to have complications from common illnesses such as the flu.You can help prevent infections by taking your HIV/AIDS medicines. Other things that can help include practicing safe sex; washing your hands well and often; and cooking your food thoroughly.
Optic Nerve Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/opticnervedisorders.html,The optic nerve is a bundle of more than 1 million nerve fibers that carry visual messages. You have one connecting the back of each eye (your retina) to your brain. Damage to an optic nerve can cause vision loss. The type of vision loss and how severe it is depends on where the damage occurs. It may affect one or both eyes.There are many different types of optic nerve disorders; including:Glaucoma is a group of diseases that are the leading cause of blindness in the United States. Glaucoma usually happens when the fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises and damages the optic nerve.Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve. Causes include infections and immune-related illnesses such as multiple sclerosis. Sometimes the cause is unknown.Optic nerve atrophy is damage to the optic nerve. Causes include poor blood flow to the eye; disease; trauma; or exposure to toxic substances.Optic nerve head drusen are pockets of protein and calcium salts that build up in the optic nerve over timeContact your health care provider if you are having vision problems. Tests for optic nerve disorders may include eye exams; ophthalmoscopy (an examination of the back of your eye); and imaging tests. Treatment depends on which disorder that you have. With some optic nerve disorders; you may get your vision back. With others; there is no treatment; or treatment may only prevent further vision loss.
Oral Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/oralcancer.html,Oral cancer can form in any part of the mouth. Most oral cancers begin in the flat cells that cover the surfaces of your mouth; tongue; and lips. Anyone can get oral cancer; but the risk is higher if you are male; use tobacco; drink lots of alcohol; have HPV; or have a history of head or neck cancer. Frequent sun exposure is also a risk factor for lip cancer. Symptoms of oral cancer include White or red patches in your mouthA mouth sore that won't healBleeding in your mouthLoose teethProblems or pain with swallowingA lump in your neckAn earacheTests to diagnose oral cancer include a physical exam; endoscopy; biopsy; and imaging tests. Oral cancer treatments may include surgery; radiation therapy; and chemotherapy. Some patients have a combination of treatments. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Dental Health,https://medlineplus.gov/dentalhealth.html,It's important to take care of your mouth and teeth starting in childhood. If you don't; you could have problems with your teeth and gums - like cavities or even tooth loss. Here's how to keep your mouth and teeth healthy:Brush your teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpasteClean between your teeth every day with floss or another type of between-the-teeth cleanerSnack smart - limit sugary snacksDon't smoke or chew tobaccoSee your dentist or oral health professional regularlyNIH: National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research
Child Dental Health,https://medlineplus.gov/childdentalhealth.html,Healthy teeth are important to your child's overall health. From the time your child is born; there are things you can do to promote healthy teeth and prevent cavities. For babies; you should clean teeth with a soft; clean cloth or baby's toothbrush.  Avoid putting the baby to bed with a bottle and check teeth regularly for spots or stains.For all children; you shouldStart using a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste when they are two years old. You might start sooner; if a dentist or doctor suggests it.Provide healthy foods and limit sweet snacks and drinksSchedule regular dental check-ups Forming good habits at a young age can help your child have healthy teeth for life. NIH: National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research
Cold Sores,https://medlineplus.gov/coldsores.html,Cold sores are caused by a contagious virus called herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two types of HSV. Type 1 usually causes oral herpes; or cold sores. Type 1 herpes virus infects more than half of the U.S. population by the time they reach their 20s. Type 2 usually affects the genital area.Some people have no symptoms from the infection. But others develop painful and unsightly cold sores. Cold sores usually occur outside the mouth; on or around the lips. When they are inside the mouth; they are usually on the gums or the roof of the mouth. They are not the same as canker sores; which are not contagious.There is no cure for cold sores. They normally go away on their own in a few weeks.  Antiviral medicines can help them heal faster.  They can also help to prevent cold sores in people who often get them. Other medicines can help with the pain and discomfort of the sores. These include ointments that numb the blisters; soften the crusts of the sores; or dry them out. Protecting your lips from the sun with sunblock lip balm can also help.
Smokeless Tobacco,https://medlineplus.gov/smokelesstobacco.html,Many people who chew tobacco or dip snuff think it's safer than smoking. But you don't have to smoke tobacco for it to be dangerous. Chewing or dipping carries risks like  Cancer of the mouth Decay of exposed tooth roots Pulling away of the gums from the teeth White patches or red sores in the mouth that can turn to cancer  Recent research shows the dangers of smokeless tobacco may go beyond the mouth. It might also play a role in other cancers; heart disease and stroke.  Smokeless tobacco contains more nicotine than cigarettes. Nicotine is a highly addictive drug that makes it hard to stop using tobacco once you start. Having a quit date and a quitting plan can help you stop successfully.  NIH: National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research
Organ Donation,https://medlineplus.gov/organdonation.html,Organ donation takes healthy organs and tissues from one person for transplantation into another. Experts say that the organs from one donor can save or help as many as 50 people. Organs you can donate includeInternal organs: Kidneys; heart; liver; pancreas; intestines; lungs Skin Bone and bone marrow CorneaMost organ and tissue donations occur after the donor has died. But some organs and tissues can be donated while the donor is alive.People of all ages and background can be organ donors. If you are under age 18; your parent or guardian must give you permission to become a donor. If you are 18 or older you can show you want to be a donor by signing a donor card. You should also let your family know your wishes.Health Resources and Services Administration
Organ Transplantation,https://medlineplus.gov/organtransplantation.html,You may need an organ transplant if one of your organs has failed. This can happen because of illness or injury. When you have an organ transplant; doctors remove an organ from another person and place it in your body.  The organ may come from a living donor or a donor who has died.The organs that can be transplanted include Heart Intestine  Kidney Liver Lung  Pancreas You often have to wait a long time for an organ transplant. Doctors must match donors to recipients to reduce the risk of transplant rejection. Rejection happens when your immune system attacks the new organ. If you have a transplant; you must take drugs the rest of your life to help keep your body from rejecting the new organ.
Throat Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/throatcancer.html,Throat cancer is a type of head and neck cancer. Throat cancer has different names; depending on which part of the throat is affected. The different parts of your throat are called the oropharynx; the hypopharynx; the nasopharynx; and the larynx; or voice box.The main risk factors for throat cancer are using tobacco heavy drinking. Certain types of throat cancer also have other risk factors. For example; having HPV is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer.Symptoms of throat cancer may includeA sore throat that does not go awayA lump in the neckPain or ringing in the earsTrouble swallowingEar painTo diagnose throat cancers; doctors may do a physical exam and history; imaging tests; and a biopsy. You may also need other tests; depending on the type of cancer. Treatments include surgery; radiation therapy; and chemotherapy. Treatment for some types of throat cancer may also include targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Orthodontia,https://medlineplus.gov/orthodontia.html,Some people have naturally straight teeth that fit together. But if you have problems with your bite or the spacing of your teeth; you may need orthodontic care. Orthodontia is the branch of dentistry that deals with abnormalities of the teeth and jaw.Orthodontic care involves the use of devices; such as braces; toStraighten teethCorrect problems with biteClose gaps between teethAlign lips and teeth properly Most people who receive orthodontic care are kids; but adults get braces; too. In young children; orthodontic treatment may guide proper jaw growth. This can help permanent teeth to come in properly.  Straight permanent teeth can help prevent tooth problems later on.
Autonomic Nervous System Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/autonomicnervoussystemdisorders.html,Your autonomic nervous system is the part of your nervous system that controls involuntary actions; such as the beating of your heart and the widening or narrowing of your blood vessels. When something goes wrong in this system; it can cause serious problems; including  Blood pressure problems Heart problems Trouble with breathing and swallowing Erectile dysfunction in men  Autonomic nervous system disorders can occur alone or as the result of another disease; such as Parkinson's disease; alcoholism and diabetes. Problems can affect either part of the system; as in complex regional pain syndromes; or all of the system. Some types are temporary; but many worsen over time. When they affect your breathing or heart function; these disorders can be life-threatening. Some autonomic nervous system disorders get better when an underlying disease is treated. Often; however; there is no cure. In that case; the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms.  NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Low Blood Pressure,https://medlineplus.gov/lowbloodpressure.html,You've probably heard that high blood pressure is a problem. Sometimes blood pressure that is too low can also cause problems.Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats; it pumps out blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats; pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest; between beats; your blood pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually they're written one above or before the other; such as 120/80. If your blood pressure reading is 90/60 or lower; you have low blood pressure. Some people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no symptoms and their low readings are normal for them. In other people; blood pressure drops below normal because of a medical condition or certain medicines. Some people may have symptoms of low blood pressure when standing up too quickly.  Low blood pressure is a problem only if it causes dizziness; fainting or in extreme cases; shock. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Paget's Disease of Bone,https://medlineplus.gov/pagetsdiseaseofbone.html,Paget's disease of bone causes your bones to grow too large and weak. They also might break easily. The disease can lead to other health problems; too; such as arthritis and hearing loss. You can have Paget's disease in any bone; but it is most common in the spine; pelvis; skull; and legs. The disease might affect one or several bones; but not your entire skeleton. More men than women have the disease. It is most common in older people. No one knows what causes Paget's disease. In some cases; a virus might be responsible. It tends to run in families. Many people do not know they have Paget's disease because their symptoms are mild. For others; symptoms can includePain Enlarged bones Broken bones Damaged cartilage in jointsDoctors use blood tests and imaging tests to diagnose Paget's disease. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent some symptoms from getting worse. Treatments include medicines and sometimes surgery. A good diet and exercise might also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Osteoarthritis,https://medlineplus.gov/osteoarthritis.html,Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It causes pain; swelling; and reduced motion in your joints. It can occur in any joint; but usually it affects your hands; knees; hips or spine.Osteoarthritis breaks down the cartilage in your joints. Cartilage is the slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones in a joint. Healthy cartilage absorbs the shock of movement. When you lose cartilage; your bones rub together. Over time; this rubbing can permanently damage the joint.Risk factors for osteoarthritis include Being overweight Getting older Injuring a joint No single test can diagnose osteoarthritis. Most doctors use several methods; including medical history; a physical exam; x-rays; or lab tests.Treatments include exercise; medicines; and sometimes surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Osteogenesis Imperfecta,https://medlineplus.gov/osteogenesisimperfecta.html,Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder in which bones break easily. Sometimes the bones break for no known reason. OI can also cause weak muscles; brittle teeth; a curved spine; and hearing loss. OI is caused by one of several genes that aren't working properly.  When these genes don't work; it affects how you make collagen; a protein that helps make bones strong. OI can range from mild to severe; and symptoms vary from person to person. A person may have just a few or as many as several hundred fractures in a lifetime.No single test can identify OI. Your doctor uses your medical and family history; physical exam; and imaging and lab tests to diagnose it. Your doctor may also test your collagen (from skin) or genes (from blood). There is no cure; but you can manage symptoms. Treatments include exercise; pain medicine; physical therapy; wheelchairs; braces; and surgery.  NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Vitamin D Deficiency,https://medlineplus.gov/vitaminddeficiency.html,What is vitamin D deficiency?Vitamin D deficiency means that you are not getting enough vitamin D to stay healthy.Why do I need vitamin D and how do I get it?Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Calcium is one of the main building blocks of bone. Vitamin D also has a role in your nervous; muscle; and immune systems.You can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin; from your diet; and from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D naturally after exposure to sunlight. But too much sun exposure can lead to skin aging and skin cancer; so many people try to get their vitamin D from other sources.How much vitamin D do I need?The amount of vitamin D you need each day depends on your age.  The recommended amounts; in international units (IU); areBirth to 12 months: 400 IUChildren 1-13 years: 600 IUTeens 14-18 years: 600 IUAdults 19-70 years: 600 IUAdults 71 years and older: 800 IUPregnant and breastfeeding women: 600 IUPeople at high risk of vitamin D deficiency may need more. Check with your health care provider about how much you need.What causes vitamin D deficiency?You can become deficient in vitamin D for different reasons:You don't get enough vitamin D in your dietYou don't absorb enough vitamin D from food (a malabsorption problem)You don't get enough exposure to sunlight.Your liver or kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form in the body.You take medicines that interfere with your body's ability to convert or absorb vitamin DWho is at risk of vitamin D deficiency?Some people are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency:Breastfed infants; because human milk is a poor source of vitamin D. If you are breastfeeding; give your infant a supplement of 400 IU of vitamin D every day.Older adults; because your skin doesn't make vitamin D when exposed to sunlight as efficiently as when you were young; and your kidneys are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form.People with dark skin; which has less ability to produce vitamin D from the sun.People with disorders such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease who don't handle fat properly; because vitamin D needs fat to be absorbed.People who have obesity; because their body fat binds to some vitamin D and prevents it from getting into the blood.People who have had gastric bypass surgeryPeople with osteoporosisPeople with chronic kidney or liver disease.People with hyperparathyroidism (too much of a hormone that controls the body's calcium level)People with sarcoidosis; tuberculosis; histoplasmosis; or other granulomatous disease (disease with granulomas; collections of cells caused by chronic inflammation)People with some lymphomas; a type of cancer.People who take medicines that affect vitamin D metabolism; such as cholestyramine (a cholesterol drug); anti-seizure drugs; glucocorticoids; antifungal drugs; and HIV/AIDS medicines.Talk with your health care provider if you are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.  There is a blood test which can measure how much vitamin D is in your body.What problems does vitamin D deficiency cause?Vitamin D deficiency can lead to a loss of bone density; which can contribute to osteoporosis and fractures.Severe vitamin D deficiency can also lead to other diseases. In children; it can cause rickets. Rickets is a rare disease that causes the bones to become soft and bend. African American infants and children are at higher risk of getting rickets. In adults; severe vitamin D deficiency leads to osteomalacia. Osteomalacia causes weak bones; bone pain; and muscle weakness.Researchers are studying vitamin D for its possible connections to several medical conditions; including diabetes; high blood pressure; cancer; and autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis. They need to do more research before they can understand the effects of vitamin D on these conditions.How can I get more vitamin D?There are a few foods that naturally have some vitamin D:Fatty fish such as salmon; tuna; and mackerelBeef liverCheeseMushroomsEgg yolksYou can also get vitamin D from fortified foods. You can check the food labels to find out whether a food has vitamin D. Foods that often have added vitamin D includeMilkBreakfast cerealsOrange juiceOther dairy products; such as yogurtSoy drinksVitamin D is in many multivitamins. There are also vitamin D supplements; both in pills and a liquid for babies.If you have vitamin D deficiency; the treatment is with supplements. Check with your health care provider about how much you need to take; how often you need to take it; and how long you need to take it.Can too much vitamin D be harmful?Getting too much vitamin D (known as vitamin D toxicity) can be harmful. Signs of toxicity include nausea; vomiting; poor appetite; constipation; weakness; and weight loss. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys. Too much vitamin D also raises the level of calcium in your blood. High levels of blood calcium (hypercalcemia) can cause confusion; disorientation; and problems with heart rhythm.Most cases of vitamin D toxicity happen when someone overuses vitamin D supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces.
Bone Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/boneinfections.html,Like other parts of the body; bones can get infected. The infections are usually bacterial; but can also be fungal. They may spread to the bone from nearby skin or muscles; or from another part of the body through the bloodstream. People who are at risk for bone infections include those with diabetes; poor circulation; or recent injury to the bone. You may also be at risk if you are having hemodialysis.  Symptoms of bone infections include  Pain in the infected area Chills and fever Swelling; warmth; and redness  A blood test or imaging test such as an x-ray can tell if you have a bone infection. Treatment includes antibiotics and often surgery.
Osteonecrosis,https://medlineplus.gov/osteonecrosis.html,Osteonecrosis is a disease caused by reduced blood flow to bones in the joints. In people with healthy bones; new bone is always replacing old bone. In osteonecrosis; the lack of blood causes the bone to break down faster than the body can make enough new bone. The bone starts to die and may break down.You can have osteonecrosis in one or several bones. It is most common in the upper leg. Other common sites are your upper arm and your knees; shoulders and ankles. The disease can affect men and women of any age; but it usually strikes in your thirties; forties or fifties. At first; you might not have any symptoms. As the disease gets worse; you will probably have joint pain that becomes more severe. You may not be able to bend or move the affected joint very well. No one is sure what causes the disease. Risk factors include Long-term steroid treatmentAlcohol abuseJoint injuriesHaving certain diseases; including arthritis and cancer  Doctors use imaging tests and other tests to diagnose osteonecrosis. Treatments include medicines; using crutches; limiting activities that put weight on the affected joints; electrical stimulation and surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Bone Density,https://medlineplus.gov/bonedensity.html,Strong bones are important for your health. A bone mineral density (BMD) test is the best way to measure your bone health. It compares your bone density; or mass; to that of a healthy person who is the same age and sex as you are. It can showWhether you have osteoporosis; a disease that makes your bones weakYour risk for breaking bonesWhether your osteoporosis treatment is workingLow bone mass that is not low enough to be osteoporosis is sometimes called osteopenia. Causes of low bone mass include family history; not developing good bone mass when you are young; and certain conditions or medicines. Not everyone who has low bone mass gets osteoporosis; but they are at higher risk for getting it.If you have low bone mass; there are things you can do to help slow down bone loss. These include eating foods rich in calcium and vitamin D and doing weight-bearing exercise such as walking; tennis; or dancing. In some cases; your doctor may prescribe medicines to prevent osteoporosis.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Osteoporosis,https://medlineplus.gov/osteoporosis.html,Osteoporosis is a disease that thins and weakens the bones. Your bones become fragile and break easily; especially the bones in the hip; spine; and wrist. In the United States; millions of people either already have osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass.Anyone can develop osteoporosis; but it is more common in older women. Risk factors includeGetting older Being small and thin Having a family history of osteoporosisTaking certain medicinesBeing a white or Asian womanHaving low bone densityOsteoporosis is a silent disease. You might not know you have it until you break a bone. A bone mineral density test is the best way to check your bone health.To keep bones strong; eat a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D; exercise; and do not smoke. If needed; medicines can also help. It is also important to try to avoid falling down. Falls are the number one cause of fractures in older adults.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Bone Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/bonecancer.html,Cancer that starts in a bone is uncommon.  Cancer that has spread to the bone from another part of the body is more common. There are three types of bone cancer:Osteosarcoma - occurs most often between ages 10 and 19. It is more common in the knee and upper arm.Chondrosarcoma - starts in cartilage; usually after age 40Ewing's sarcoma - occurs most often in children and teens under 19. It is more common in boys than girls.The most common symptom of bone cancer is pain. Other symptoms vary; depending on the location and size of the cancer. Surgery is often the main treatment for bone cancer. Other treatments may include amputation; chemotherapy; and radiation therapy. Because bone cancer can come back after treatment; regular follow-up visits are important.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Ostomy,https://medlineplus.gov/ostomy.html,An ostomy is surgery to create an opening (stoma) from an area inside the body to the outside. It treats certain diseases of the digestive or urinary systems. It can be permanent; when an organ must be removed.  It can be temporary; when the organ needs time to heal.  The organ could be the small intestine; colon; rectum; or bladder. With an ostomy; there must be a new way for wastes to leave the body. There are many different types of ostomy. Some examples areIleostomy - the bottom of the small intestine (ileum) is attached to the stoma. This bypasses the colon; rectum and anus.Colostomy - the colon is attached to the stoma. This bypasses the rectum and the anus. Urostomy - the tubes that carry urine to the bladder are attached to the stoma. This bypasses the bladder.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Over-the-Counter Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/overthecountermedicines.html,Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are drugs you can buy without a prescription. Some OTC medicines relieve aches; pains and itches. Some prevent or cure diseases; like tooth decay and athlete's foot. Others help manage recurring problems; like migraines.  In the United States; the Food and Drug Administration decides whether a medicine is safe enough to sell over-the-counter.  Taking OTC medicines still has risks. Some interact with other medicines; supplements; foods or drinks. Others cause problems for people with certain medical conditions. If you're pregnant; talk to your health care provider before taking any medicines. It is important to take medicines correctly; and be careful when giving them to children. More medicine does not necessarily mean better. You should never take OTC medicines longer or in higher doses than the label recommends. If your symptoms don't go away; it's a clear signal that it's time to see your health care provider. Food and Drug Administration
Ear Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/earinfections.html,Ear infections are the most common reason parents bring their child to a doctor. Three out of four children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday.  Adults can also get ear infections; but they are less common.The infection usually affects the middle ear and is called otitis media. The tubes inside the ears become clogged with fluid and mucus. This can affect hearing; because sound cannot get through all that fluid.If your child isn't old enough to say "My ear hurts;" here are a few things to look forTugging at earsCrying more than usualFluid draining from the earTrouble sleepingBalance difficultiesHearing problemsYour health care provider will diagnose an ear infection by looking inside the ear with an instrument called an otoscope.Often; ear infections go away on their own. Your health care provider may recommend pain relievers. Severe infections and infections in young babies may require antibiotics. Children who get infections often may need surgery to place small tubes inside their ears. The tubes relieve pressure in the ears so that the child can hear again.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Ovarian Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/ovariancancer.html,The ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. They produce a woman's eggs and female hormones. Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond.Cancer of the ovary is not common; but it causes more deaths than other female reproductive cancers. The sooner ovarian cancer is found and treated; the better your chance for recovery. But ovarian cancer is hard to detect early. Women with ovarian cancer may have no symptoms or just mild symptoms until the disease is in an advanced stage. Then it is hard to treat. Symptoms may includeA heavy feeling in the pelvisPain in the lower abdomen Bleeding from the vagina Weight gain or loss Abnormal periods Unexplained back pain that gets worse Gas; nausea; vomiting; or loss of appetiteTo diagnose ovarian cancer; doctors do one or more tests. They include a physical exam; a pelvic exam; lab tests; ultrasound; or a biopsy. Treatment is usually surgery followed by chemotherapy.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Ovarian Cysts,https://medlineplus.gov/ovariancysts.html,The ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. They produce a woman's eggs and make female hormones. Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs in or on an ovary. They usually form during ovulation; when the ovary releases an egg. They are usually harmless and go away by themselves. Most women have them sometime during their lives.Most ovarian cysts are small and don't cause symptoms. Women may not find out that they have them until they have a pelvic exam. If there are symptoms; they may includePressureBloatingSwellingPain in the lower abdomen; on the side where the cyst isIf your health care provider finds a cyst; you may be able to wait to see if it gets bigger. You may need surgery if you have pain; are past menopause; or if the cyst does not go away. If a cyst bursts or causes bleeding; you should get medical help right away. Birth control pills can help prevent new cysts.Rarely; ovarian cysts can become cancerous. This risk increases as you get older.A health problem that involves ovarian cysts is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  Women with PCOS can have high levels of male hormones; irregular or no periods; and small ovarian cysts.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Ovarian Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/ovariandisorders.html,The ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. Women have two ovaries; one on each side of the uterus.  Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond.The ovaries produce and store a woman's eggs. During ovulation; an ovary releases an egg. If that egg is fertilized by a sperm; a pregnancy can occur. Ovaries also make the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. When a woman goes through menopause; her ovaries stop making those hormones and releasing eggs.Problems with the ovaries includeOvarian cancerOvarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndromePremature ovarian failureOvarian torsion; a twisting of the ovary

Premature Ovarian Failure,https://medlineplus.gov/prematureovarianfailure.html,Premature ovarian failure (POF) is when a woman's ovaries stop working before she is 40.POF is different from premature menopause. With premature menopause; your periods stop before age 40. You can no longer get pregnant. The cause can be natural or it can be a disease; surgery; chemotherapy; or radiation. With POF; some women still have occasional periods. They may even get pregnant.  In most cases of POF; the cause is unknown.Missed periods are usually the first sign of POF. Later symptoms may be similar to those of natural menopause:Hot flashesNight sweatsIrritabilityPoor concentrationDecreased sex drivePain during sexVaginal drynessDoctors diagnose POF by doing a physical exam and lab and imaging tests.Most women with POF cannot get pregnant naturally. Fertility treatments help a few women; others use donor eggs to have children. There is no treatment that will restore normal ovarian function. However; many health care providers suggest taking hormones until age 50. NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Over-the-Counter Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/overthecountermedicines.html,Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are drugs you can buy without a prescription. Some OTC medicines relieve aches; pains and itches. Some prevent or cure diseases; like tooth decay and athlete's foot. Others help manage recurring problems; like migraines.  In the United States; the Food and Drug Administration decides whether a medicine is safe enough to sell over-the-counter.  Taking OTC medicines still has risks. Some interact with other medicines; supplements; foods or drinks. Others cause problems for people with certain medical conditions. If you're pregnant; talk to your health care provider before taking any medicines. It is important to take medicines correctly; and be careful when giving them to children. More medicine does not necessarily mean better. You should never take OTC medicines longer or in higher doses than the label recommends. If your symptoms don't go away; it's a clear signal that it's time to see your health care provider. Food and Drug Administration
Overactive Bladder,https://medlineplus.gov/overactivebladder.html,Overactive bladder is a condition in which the bladder squeezes urine out at the wrong time. You may have overactive bladder if you have two or more of these symptoms:You urinate eight or more times a day or two or more times at nightYou have the sudden; strong need to urinate immediatelyYou leak urine after a sudden; strong urge to urinateYou also may have incontinence; a loss of bladder control. Nerve problems; too much fluid; or too much caffeine can cause it. Often the cause is unknown.Your doctor may prescribe a medicine that can calm muscles and nerves. The medicine may come as a pill; a liquid; or a patch. The medicines can cause your eyes to become dry. They can also cause dry mouth and constipation.  To deal with these effects; use eye drops to keep your eyes moist; chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy if dry mouth bothers you; and take small sips of water throughout the day.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Hyperthyroidism,https://medlineplus.gov/hyperthyroidism.html,Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck; just above your collarbone. It is one of your endocrine glands; which make hormones. Thyroid hormones control the rate of many activities in your body. These include how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats. All of these activities are your body's metabolism. If your thyroid is too active; it makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs. This is called hyperthyroidism.Hyperthyroidism is more common in women; people with other thyroid problems; and those over 60 years old. Graves' disease; an autoimmune disorder; is the most common cause.  Other causes include thyroid nodules; thyroiditis; consuming too much iodine; and taking too much synthetic thyroid hormone.The symptoms can vary from person to person.  They may includeBeing nervous or irritableMood swingsFatigue or muscle weaknessHeat intoleranceTrouble sleepingHand tremorsRapid and irregular heartbeatFrequent bowel movements or diarrheaWeight lossGoiter; which is an enlarged thyroid that may cause the neck to look swollenTo diagnose hyperthyroidism; your doctor will do a physical exam; look at your symptoms; and do thyroid tests. Treatment is with medicines; radioiodine therapy; or thyroid surgery. No single treatment works for everyone.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Body Weight,https://medlineplus.gov/bodyweight.html, Do you know if your current weight is healthy?  "Underweight"; "normal"; "overweight"; and "obese" are all labels for ranges of weight. Obese and overweight mean that your weight is greater than it should be for your health. Underweight means that it is lower than it should be for your health. Your healthy body weight depends on your sex and height. For children; it also depends on your age.A sudden; unexpected change in weight can be a sign of a medical problem.  Causes for sudden weight loss can includeThyroid problemsCancerInfectious diseasesDigestive diseasesCertain medicinesSudden weight gain can be due to medicines; thyroid problems; heart failure; and kidney disease.Good nutrition and exercise can help in losing weight. Eating extra calories within a well-balanced diet and treating any underlying medical problems can help to add weight.
Obesity,https://medlineplus.gov/obesity.html,Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight; which means weighing too much.  The weight may come from muscle; bone; fat; and/or body water.  Both terms mean that a person's weight is greater than what's considered healthy for his or her height. Obesity happens over time when you eat more calories than you use. The balance between calories-in and calories-out differs for each person. Factors that might affect your weight include your genetic makeup; overeating; eating high-fat foods; and not being physically active. Obesity increases your risk of diabetes; heart disease; stroke; arthritis; and some cancers. If you have obesity; losing even 5 to 10 percent of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases. For example; that means losing 10 to 20 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Oxygen Therapy,https://medlineplus.gov/oxygentherapy.html,Oxygen therapy is a treatment that provides you with extra oxygen. Oxygen is a gas that your body needs to function. Normally; your lungs absorb oxygen from the air you breathe. But some conditions can prevent you from getting enough oxygen.You may need oxygen if you haveCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)PneumoniaA severe asthma attackLate-stage heart failureCystic fibrosisSleep apneaThe oxygen comes through nasal prongs; a mask; or a breathing tube. If you have a chronic problem; you may have a portable oxygen tank or a machine in your home.A different kind of oxygen therapy is called hyperbaric oxygen therapy. It uses oxygen at high pressure to treat wounds and serious infections.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Ozone,https://medlineplus.gov/ozone.html,Ozone is a gas. It can be good or bad; depending on where it is. "Good" ozone occurs naturally about 10 to 30 miles above the Earth's surface. It shields us from the sun's ultraviolet rays. Part of the good ozone layer is gone. Man-made chemicals have destroyed it. Without enough good ozone; people may get too much ultraviolet radiation.  This may increase the risk of skin cancer; cataracts; and immune system problems."Bad" ozone is at ground level. It forms when pollutants from cars; factories; and other sources react chemically with sunlight. It is the main ingredient in smog. It is usually worst in the summer. Breathing bad ozone can be harmful. It can cause coughing; throat irritation; worsening of asthma; bronchitis; and emphysema. It can lead to permanent lung damage; if you are regularly exposed to it.Environmental Protection Agency
Pacemakers and Implantable Defibrillators,https://medlineplus.gov/pacemakersandimplantabledefibrillators.html,An arrhythmia is any disorder of your heart rate or rhythm. It means that your heart beats too quickly; too slowly; or with an irregular pattern. Most arrhythmias result from problems in the electrical system of the heart. If your arrhythmia is serious; you may need a cardiac pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).  They are devices that are implanted in your chest or abdomen.A pacemaker helps control abnormal heart rhythms. It uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. It can speed up a slow heart rhythm; control a fast heart rhythm; and coordinate the chambers of the heart.An ICD monitors heart rhythms. If it senses dangerous rhythms; it delivers shocks. This treatment is called defibrillation. An ICD can help control life-threatening arrhythmias; especially those that can cause sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Most new ICDs can act as both a pacemaker and a defibrillator. Many ICDs also record the heart's electrical patterns when there is an abnormal heartbeat. This can help the doctor plan future treatment.Getting a pacemaker or ICD requires minor surgery. You usually need to stay in the hospital for a day or two; so your doctor can make sure that the device is working well. You will probably be back to your normal activities within a few days.

Differences in the health of groups can result from:GeneticsEnvironmental factorsAccess to careCultural factorsOn this page; you'll find links to health issues that affect Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.
Peripheral Arterial Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/peripheralarterialdisease.html,Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) happens when there is a narrowing of the blood vessels outside of your heart. The cause of PAD is atherosclerosis. This happens when plaque builds up on the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the arms and legs. Plaque is a substance made up of fat and cholesterol. It causes the arteries to narrow or become blocked. This can reduce or stop blood flow; usually to the legs. If severe enough; blocked blood flow can cause tissue death and can sometimes lead to amputation of the foot or leg.The main risk factor for PAD is smoking. Other risk factors include older age and diseases like diabetes; high blood cholesterol; high blood pressure; heart disease; and stroke.Many people who have PAD don't have any symptoms. If you have symptoms; they may includePain; numbness; achiness; or heaviness in the leg muscles. This happens when walking or climbing stairs.Weak or absent pulses in the legs or feetSores or wounds on the toes; feet; or legs that heal slowly; poorly; or not at allA pale or bluish color to the skinA lower temperature in one leg than the other legPoor nail growth on the toes and decreased hair growth on the legsErectile dysfunction; especially among men who have diabetesPAD can increase your risk of heart attack; stroke; and transient ischemic attack.Doctors diagnose PAD with a physical exam and heart and imaging tests. Treatments include lifestyle changes; medicines; and sometimes surgery. Lifestyle changes include dietary changes; exercise; and efforts to lower high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Paget's Disease of Bone,https://medlineplus.gov/pagetsdiseaseofbone.html,Paget's disease of bone causes your bones to grow too large and weak. They also might break easily. The disease can lead to other health problems; too; such as arthritis and hearing loss. You can have Paget's disease in any bone; but it is most common in the spine; pelvis; skull; and legs. The disease might affect one or several bones; but not your entire skeleton. More men than women have the disease. It is most common in older people. No one knows what causes Paget's disease. In some cases; a virus might be responsible. It tends to run in families. Many people do not know they have Paget's disease because their symptoms are mild. For others; symptoms can includePain Enlarged bones Broken bones Damaged cartilage in jointsDoctors use blood tests and imaging tests to diagnose Paget's disease. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent some symptoms from getting worse. Treatments include medicines and sometimes surgery. A good diet and exercise might also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Breast Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/breastcancer.html,Breast cancer affects one in eight women during their lives. No one knows why some women get breast cancer; but there are many risk factors. Risks that you cannot change includeAge - the risk rises as you get olderGenes - two genes; BRCA1 and BRCA2; greatly increase the risk. Women who have family members with breast or ovarian cancer may wish to be tested for the genes.Personal factors - beginning periods before age 12 or going through menopause after age 55Other risks include obesity; using hormone replacement therapy (also called menopausal hormone therapy); taking birth control pills; drinking alcohol; not having children or having your first child after age 35; and having dense breasts.Symptoms of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast; a change in size or shape of the breast; and discharge from a nipple. Breast self-exams and mammography can help find breast cancer early; when it is most treatable. One possible treatment is surgery. It could be a lumpectomy or a mastectomy. Other treatments include radiation therapy; chemotherapy; hormone therapy; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.Men can have breast cancer; too; but it is rare.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/pain.html,Pain is a signal in your nervous system that something may be wrong. It is an unpleasant feeling; such as a prick; tingle; sting; burn; or ache. Pain may be sharp or dull. It may come and go; or it may be constant. You may feel pain in one area of your body; such as your back; abdomen; chest; pelvis; or you may feel pain all overPain can be helpful in diagnosing a problem. If you never felt pain; you might seriously hurt yourself without knowing it; or you might not realize you have a medical problem that needs treatment.There are two types of pain: acute and chronic. Acute pain usually comes on suddenly; because of a disease; injury; or inflammation. It can often be diagnosed and treated. It usually goes away; though sometimes it can turn into chronic pain. Chronic pain lasts for a long time; and can cause severe problems.Pain is not always curable; but there are many ways to treat it. Treatment depends on the cause and type of pain. Pain relievers and other medicines; acupuncture; physical therapy; and sometimes surgery may be helpful.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Pain Relievers,https://medlineplus.gov/painrelievers.html,Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve headaches; sore muscles; arthritis; or other aches and pains.  There are many different pain medicines; and each one has advantages and risks. Some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others. Each person may also have a slightly different response to a pain reliever. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are good for many types of pain. There are two main types of OTC pain medicines: acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin; naproxen (Aleve); and ibuprofen (Advil; Motrin) are examples of OTC NSAIDs.If OTC medicines don't relieve your pain; your doctor may prescribe something stronger. Many NSAIDs are also available at higher prescription doses. The most powerful pain relievers are opioids. They are very effective; but they can sometimes have serious side effects. There is also a risk of addiction. Because of the risks; you must use them only under a doctor's supervision.There are many things you can do to help ease pain. Pain relievers are just one part of a pain treatment plan.
Abdominal Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/abdominalpain.html,Your abdomen extends from below your chest to your groin. Some people call it the stomach; but your abdomen contains many other important organs. Pain in the abdomen can come from any one of them. The pain may start somewhere else; such as your chest. Severe pain doesn't always mean a serious problem. Nor does mild pain mean a problem is not serious. Call your health care provider if mild pain lasts a week or more or if you have pain with other symptoms. Get medical help immediately ifYou have abdominal pain that is sudden and sharpYou also have pain in your chest; neck or shoulder You're vomiting blood or have blood in your stool Your abdomen is stiff; hard and tender to touch You can't move your bowels; especially if you're also vomiting
Back Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/backpain.html,If you've ever groaned; "Oh; my aching back!"; you are not alone. Back pain is one of the most common medical problems; affecting 8 out of 10 people at some point during their lives. Back pain can range from a dull; constant ache to a sudden; sharp pain. Acute back pain comes on suddenly and usually lasts from a few days to a few weeks. Back pain is called chronic if it lasts for more than three months.Most back pain goes away on its own; though it may take awhile. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers and resting can help. However; staying in bed for more than 1 or 2 days can make it worse. If your back pain is severe or doesn't improve after three days; you should call your health care provider.  You should also get medical attention if you have back pain following an injury.Treatment for back pain depends on what kind of pain you have; and what is causing it. It may include hot or cold packs; exercise; medicines; injections; complementary treatments; and sometimes surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Chest Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/chestpain.html,Having a pain in your chest can be scary.  It does not always mean that you are having a heart attack.  There can be many other causes; includingOther heart problems; such as anginaPanic attacksDigestive problems; such as heartburn or esophagus disordersSore musclesLung diseases; such as pneumonia; pleurisy; or pulmonary embolismCostochondritis - an inflammation of joints in your chestSome of these problems can be serious.  Get immediate medical care if you have chest pain that does not go away; crushing pain or pressure in the chest; or chest pain along with nausea; sweating; dizziness or shortness of breath. Treatment depends on the cause of the pain.
Chronic Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/chronicpain.html,Pain is a signal in your nervous system that something may be wrong.  It is an unpleasant feeling; such as a prick; tingle; sting; burn; or ache. Pain may be sharp or dull. You may feel pain in one area of your body; or all over.  There are two types: acute pain and chronic pain.

The original cause may have been an injury or infection. There may be an ongoing cause of pain; such as arthritis or cancer. In some cases there is no clear cause. Environmental and psychological factors can make chronic pain worse.Many older adults have chronic pain. Women also report having more chronic pain than men; and they are at a greater risk for many pain conditions. Some people have two or more chronic pain conditions.Chronic pain is not always curable; but treatments can help.

Pancreas Transplantation,https://medlineplus.gov/pancreastransplantation.html,The pancreas is a gland behind your stomach and in front of your spine. It produces the juices that help break down food and the hormones that help control blood sugar levels. A pancreas transplant is surgery to place a healthy pancreas from a donor into a person with a diseased pancreas.  It is mostly done for people with severe type 1 diabetes. It can allow them to give up insulin shots.  An experimental procedure called islet cell transplantation transplants only the parts of the pancreas that make insulin.People who have transplants must take drugs to keep their body from rejecting the new pancreas for the rest of their lives. They must also have regular follow-up care. Because of the risks; it is not a common treatment for type 1 diabetes.
Pancreatic Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/pancreaticcancer.html,The pancreas is a gland behind your stomach and in front of your spine. It produces the juices that help break down food and the hormones that help control blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer usually begins in the cells that produce the juices. Some risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer includeSmoking Long-term diabetes Chronic pancreatitis Certain hereditary disorders Pancreatic cancer is hard to catch early. It doesn't cause symptoms right away. When you do get symptoms; they are often vague or you may not notice them. They include yellowing of the skin and eyes; pain in the abdomen and back; weight loss and fatigue. Also; because the pancreas is hidden behind other organs; health care providers cannot see or feel the tumors during routine exams. Doctors use a physical exam; blood tests; imaging tests; and a biopsy to diagnose it.Because it is often found late and it spreads quickly; pancreatic cancer can be hard to treat.  Possible treatments include surgery; radiation; chemotherapy; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Pancreatic Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/pancreaticdiseases.html,The pancreas is a gland behind your stomach and in front of your spine. It produces juices that help break down food and hormones that help control blood sugar levels. Problems with the pancreas can lead to many health problems. These includePancreatitis; or inflammation of the pancreas: This happens when digestive enzymes start digesting the pancreas itself Pancreatic cancer Cystic fibrosis; a genetic disorder in which thick; sticky mucus can also block tubes in your pancreasThe pancreas also plays a role in diabetes. In type 1 diabetes; the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin because the body's immune system has attacked them. In  type 2 diabetes; the pancreas loses the ability to secrete enough insulin in response to meals.
Pancreatitis,https://medlineplus.gov/pancreatitis.html,The pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach and close to the first part of the small intestine. It secretes digestive juices into the small intestine through a tube called the pancreatic duct. The pancreas also releases the hormones insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream.Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. It happens when digestive enzymes start digesting the pancreas itself. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Either form is serious and can lead to complications.Acute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and usually goes away in a few days with treatment. It is often caused by gallstones.  Common symptoms are severe pain in the upper abdomen; nausea; and vomiting.   Treatment is usually a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids; antibiotics; and medicines to relieve pain.Chronic pancreatitis does not heal or improve. It gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. The most common cause is heavy alcohol use. Other causes include cystic fibrosis and other inherited disorders; high levels of calcium or fats in the blood; some medicines; and autoimmune conditions. Symptoms include nausea; vomiting; weight loss; and oily stools. Treatment may also be a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids; medicines to relieve pain; and nutritional support. After that; you may need to start taking enzymes and eat a special diet.  It is also important to not smoke or drink alcohol.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Panic Disorder,https://medlineplus.gov/panicdisorder.html,Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder.  It causes panic attacks; which are sudden feelings of terror when there is no real danger.  You may feel as if you are losing control. You may also have physical symptoms; such asFast heartbeatChest or stomach painBreathing difficultyWeakness or dizzinessSweatingFeeling hot or a cold chillTingly or numb handsPanic attacks can happen anytime; anywhere; and without warning. You may live in fear of another attack and may avoid places where you have had an attack. For some people; fear takes over their lives and they cannot leave their homes.Panic disorder is more common in women than men.  It usually starts when people are young adults. Sometimes it starts when a person is under a lot of stress. Most people get better with treatment. Therapy can show you how to recognize and change your thinking patterns before they lead to panic.  Medicines can also help.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
B Vitamins,https://medlineplus.gov/bvitamins.html,The B vitamins are  B1 (thiamine) B2 (riboflavin) B3 (niacin) B5 (pantothenic acid) B6 B7 (biotin) B12 Folic acid  These vitamins help the process your body uses to get or make energy from the food you eat. They also help form red blood cells.  You can get B vitamins from proteins such as fish; poultry; meat; eggs; and dairy products.  Leafy green vegetables; beans; and peas also have B vitamins.  Many cereals and some breads have added B vitamins. Not getting enough of certain B vitamins can cause diseases.  A lack of B12 or B6 can cause anemia.
Paralysis,https://medlineplus.gov/paralysis.html,Paralysis is the loss of muscle function in part of your body. It happens when something goes wrong with the way messages pass between your brain and muscles. Paralysis can be complete or partial. It can occur on one or both sides of your body. It can also occur in just one area; or it can be widespread. Paralysis of the lower half of your body; including both legs; is called paraplegia. Paralysis of the arms and legs is quadriplegia.  Most paralysis is due to strokes or injuries such as spinal cord injury or a broken neck. Other causes of paralysis include  Nerve diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Autoimmune diseases such as Guillain-Barre syndrome  Bell's palsy; which affects muscles in the face  Polio used to be a cause of paralysis; but polio no longer occurs in the U.S.
Parkinson's Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/parkinsonsdisease.html,Parkinson's disease (PD) is a type of movement disorder. It happens when nerve cells in the brain don't produce enough of a brain chemical called dopamine. Sometimes it is genetic; but most cases do not seem to run in families. Exposure to chemicals in the environment might play a role.Symptoms begin gradually; often on one side of the body.  Later they affect both sides. They  includeTrembling of hands; arms; legs; jaw and face Stiffness of the arms; legs and trunk Slowness of movement Poor balance and coordination As symptoms get worse; people with the disease may have trouble walking; talking; or doing simple tasks. They may also have problems such as depression; sleep problems; or trouble chewing; swallowing; or speaking.There is no lab test for PD; so it can be difficult to diagnose.  Doctors use a medical history and a neurological examination to diagnose it.PD usually begins around age 60; but it can start earlier. It is more common in men than in women. There is no cure for PD. A variety of medicines sometimes help symptoms dramatically. Surgery and deep brain stimulation (DBS) can help severe cases. With DBS; electrodes are surgically implanted in the brain. They send electrical pulses to stimulate the parts of the brain that control movement.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Polio and Post-Polio Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/polioandpostpoliosyndrome.html,Polio is an infectious disease caused by a virus. The virus lives in an infected person's throat and intestines. It is most often spread by contact with the stool of an infected person. You can also get it from droplets if an infected person sneezes or coughs. It can contaminate food and water if people do not wash their hands.Most people have no symptoms. If you have symptoms; they may include fever; fatigue; nausea; headache; flu-like symptoms; stiff neck and back; and pain in the limbs. A few people will become paralyzed. There is no treatment to reverse the paralysis of polio. Some people who've had polio develop post-polio syndrome (PPS) years later.  Symptoms include tiredness; new muscle weakness; and muscle and joint pain.

Parathyroid Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/parathyroiddisorders.html,Most people have four pea-sized glands; called parathyroid glands; on the thyroid gland in the neck. Though their names are similar; the thyroid and parathyroid glands are completely different. The parathyroid glands make parathyroid hormone (PTH); which helps your body keep the right balance of calcium and phosphorous.If your parathyroid glands make too much or too little hormone; it disrupts this balance. If they secrete extra PTH; you have hyperparathyroidism; and your blood calcium rises. In many cases; a benign tumor on a parathyroid gland makes it overactive. Or; the extra hormones can come from enlarged parathyroid glands. Very rarely; the cause is cancer.If you do not have enough PTH; you have hypoparathyroidism. Your blood will have too little calcium and too much phosphorous. Causes include injury to the glands; endocrine disorders; or genetic conditions. Treatment is aimed at restoring the balance of calcium and phosphorous.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

But some can lead to a permanent loss of vision.Common eye problems includeRefractive errorsCataracts - clouded lensesOptic nerve disorders; including glaucomaRetinal disorders - problems with the nerve layer at the back of the eyeMacular degeneration - a disease that destroys sharp; central visionDiabetic eye problemsConjunctivitis - an  infection also known as pinkeyeYour best defense is to have regular checkups; because eye diseases do not always have symptoms. Early detection and treatment could prevent vision loss. See an eye care professional right away if you have a sudden change in vision; if everything looks dim; or if you see flashes of light. Other symptoms that need quick attention are pain; double vision; fluid coming from the eye; and inflammation.NIH: National Eye Institute
Pinkeye,https://medlineplus.gov/pinkeye.html,Conjunctivitis is the medical name for pink eye. It involves inflammation of the outer layer of the eye and inside of the eyelid. It can cause swelling; itching; burning; discharge; and redness. Causes include Bacterial or viral infectionAllergies Substances that cause irritationContact lens products; eye drops; or eye ointmentsPinkeye usually does not affect vision. Infectious pink eye can easily spread from one person to another. The infection will clear in most cases without medical care; but bacterial pinkeye needs treatment with antibiotic eye drops or ointment.NIH: National Eye Institute
Pinworms,https://medlineplus.gov/pinworms.html,Pinworms are small parasites that can live in the colon and rectum.   You get them when you swallow their eggs. The eggs hatch inside your intestines. While you sleep; the female pinworms leave the intestines through the anus and  lay eggs on nearby skin.Pinworms spread easily. When people who are infected touch their anus; the eggs attach to their fingertips.  They can spread the eggs to others directly through their hands; or through contaminated clothing; bedding; food; or other articles. The eggs can live on household surfaces for up to 2 weeks.The infection is more common in children. Many people have no symptoms at all. Some people feel itching around the anus or vagina. The itching may become intense; interfere with sleep; and make you irritable.Your health care provider can diagnose pinworm infection by finding the eggs. A common way to collect the eggs is with a sticky piece of clear tape. Mild infections may not need treatment.  If you do need medicine; everyone in the household should take it. To prevent becoming infected or reinfected with pinworms;Bathe after waking upWash your pajamas and bed sheets oftenWash your hands regularly; especially after using the bathroom or changing diapersChange your underwear every dayAvoid nail bitingAvoid scratching the anal areaNIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Pituitary Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/pituitarydisorders.html,Your pituitary gland is a pea-sized gland at the base of your brain. The pituitary is the "master control gland" - it makes hormones that affect growth and the functions of other glands in the body.

Pituitary Tumors,https://medlineplus.gov/pituitarytumors.html,Your pituitary gland is a pea-sized gland at the base of your brain. The pituitary is the "master control gland" - it makes hormones that affect growth and the functions of other glands in the body. Pituitary tumors are common; but often they don't cause health problems. Most people with pituitary tumors never even know they have them. The most common type of pituitary tumor produces hormones and disrupts the balance of hormones in your body. This can cause endocrine diseases such as Cushing's syndrome and hyperthyroidism.Symptoms of pituitary tumors includeHeadaches Vision problemsNausea and vomitingProblems caused by the production of too many hormonesPituitary tumors are usually curable. Treatment is often surgery to remove the tumor. Other options include medicines; radiation therapy; and chemotherapy.
Phenylketonuria,https://medlineplus.gov/phenylketonuria.html,Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a type of amino acid metabolism disorder. It is inherited. If you have it; your body can't process part of a protein called phenylalanine (Phe). Phe is in almost all foods. If your Phe level gets too high; it can damage your brain and cause severe intellectual disability.  All babies born in U.S. hospitals must now have a screening test for PKU. This makes it easier to diagnose and treat the problem early. The best treatment for PKU is a diet of low-protein foods. There are special formulas for newborns.  For older children and adults; the diet includes many fruits and vegetables. It also includes some low-protein breads; pastas and cereals. Nutritional formulas provide the vitamins and minerals you can't get from their food.Babies who get on this special diet soon after they are born develop normally. Many have no symptoms of PKU. It is important to stay on the diet for the rest of your life.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Plague,https://medlineplus.gov/plague.html,Plague is an infection caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The bacteria are found mainly in rats and in the fleas that feed on them. People and other animals can get plague from rat or flea bites. In the past; plague destroyed entire civilizations. Today plague is uncommon; due to better living conditions and antibiotics.There are three forms of plague:Bubonic plague causes the tonsils; adenoids; spleen; and thymus to become inflamed.  Symptoms include fever; aches; chills; and tender lymph glands.In septicemic plague; bacteria multiply in the blood. It causes fever; chills; shock; and bleeding under the skin or other organs.Pneumonic plague is the most serious form. Bacteria enter the lungs and cause pneumonia. People with the infection can spread this form to others. This type could be a bioterror agent.Lab tests can diagnose plague. Treatment is a strong antibiotic. There is no vaccine.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Heel Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/heelinjuriesanddisorders.html,Heel problems are common and can be painful.

When they are blocked; you can suffer angina or a heart attack.Carotid artery disease. These arteries supply blood to your brain. When they are blocked you can suffer a stroke.Peripheral arterial disease. These arteries are in your arms; legs and pelvis. When they are blocked; you can suffer from numbness; pain and sometimes infections.Atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause symptoms until it severely narrows or totally blocks an artery. Many people don't know they have it until they have a medical emergency.A physical exam; imaging; and other diagnostic tests can tell if you have it. Medicines can slow the progress of plaque buildup. Your doctor may also recommend procedures such as angioplasty to open the arteries; or surgery on the coronary or carotid arteries. Lifestyle changes can also help. These include following a healthy diet; getting regular exercise; maintaining a healthy weight; quitting smoking; and managing stress.

In gingivitis; the gums become red and swollen. They can bleed easily. Gingivitis is a mild form of gum disease. You can usually reverse it  with daily brushing and flossing and regular cleanings by a dentist or dental hygienist. Untreated gingivitis can lead to periodontitis. If you have periodontitis; the gums pull away from the teeth and form pockets that  become infected. If not treated; the bones; gums and connective tissue that support the teeth are destroyed. NIH: National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research
Tooth Decay,https://medlineplus.gov/toothdecay.html,You call it a cavity. Your dentist calls it tooth decay or dental caries.  They're all names for a hole in your tooth. The cause of tooth decay is plaque; a sticky substance in your mouth made up mostly of germs. Tooth decay starts in the outer layer; called the enamel. Without a filling; the decay can get deep into the tooth and its nerves and cause a toothache or abscess. To help prevent cavities  Brush your teeth every day with a fluoride toothpaste Clean between your teeth every day with floss or another type of between-the-teeth cleaner Snack smart - limit sugary snacks See your dentist or oral health professional regularly

Platelet Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/plateletdisorders.html,Platelets are little pieces of blood cells. Platelets help wounds heal and prevent bleeding by forming blood clots. Your bone marrow makes platelets.  Problems can result from having too few or too many platelets; or from platelets that do not work properly.If your blood has a low number of platelets; it is called thrombocytopenia. This can put you at risk for mild to serious bleeding.   If your blood has too many platelets; you may have a higher risk of blood clots.  With other platelet disorders; the platelets do not work as they should.  For example; in von Willebrand Disease; the platelets cannot stick together or cannot attach to blood vessel walls.  This can cause excessive bleeding.  Treatment of platelet disorders depends on the cause.  NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Pleural Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/pleuraldisorders.html,Your pleura is a large; thin sheet of tissue that wraps around the outside of your lungs and lines the inside of your chest cavity.

Pneumocystis Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/pneumocystisinfections.html,Pneumocystis jirovecii is a tiny fungus that lives in the lungs of many people. Most people's immune systems keep the fungus under control. But if you have a weakened immune system; the fungus can make you very sick.The most common type of infection is pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). PCP once was the major cause of death for people with HIV/AIDS. But now; it is possible to prevent or treat most cases.  The key to surviving PCP is early treatment. The first signs of PCP are fever; dry cough; shortness of breath; and fatigue. If you have a weakened immune system and have these symptoms; see your doctor right away.To diagnose PCP; doctors use a microscope to look for the fungus in a sample of lung fluid or tissue. Treatment is with antibiotics.There is no vaccine to prevent PCP. Some people who are at high risk of getting PCP may need to take antibiotics to prevent it.
Pneumonia,https://medlineplus.gov/pneumonia.html,Pneumonia is an infection in one or both of the lungs. Many germs; such as bacteria; viruses; and fungi; can cause pneumonia.  You can also get pneumonia by inhaling a liquid or chemical.

There may be a specific cause; such as Legionnaire's disease. Sometimes the cause of the illness cannot be found. This is known as sick building syndrome.Usually indoor air quality problems only cause discomfort. Most people feel better as soon as they remove the source of the pollution.  However; some pollutants can cause diseases that show up much later; such as respiratory diseases or cancer.Making sure that your building is well-ventilated and getting rid of pollutants can improve the quality of your indoor air.Environmental Protection Agency
Water Pollution,https://medlineplus.gov/waterpollution.html,We all need clean water. People need it to grow crops and to operate factories; and for drinking and recreation.  Fish and wildlife depend on it to survive. Many different pollutants can harm our rivers; streams; lakes; and oceans.  The three most common are soil; nutrients; and bacteria. Rain washes soil into streams and rivers. The soil can kill tiny animals and fish eggs. It can clog the gills of fish and block light; causing plants to die. Nutrients; often from fertilizers; cause problems in lakes; ponds; and reservoirs. Nitrogen and phosphorus make algae grow and can turn water green. Bacteria; often from sewage spills; can pollute fresh or salt water. You can help protect your water supply:Don't pour household products such as cleansers; beauty products; medicines; auto fluids; paint; and lawn care products down the drain. Take them to a hazardous waste collection site.Throw away excess household grease (meat fats; lard; cooking oil; shortening; butter; margarine; etc.) diapers; condoms; and personal hygiene products in the garbage can.Clean up after your pets. Pet waste contains nutrients and germs.Environmental Protection Agency
Cartilage Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/cartilagedisorders.html,Cartilage is the tough but flexible tissue that covers the ends of your bones at a joint. It also gives shape and support to other parts of your body; such as your ears; nose and windpipe. Healthy cartilage helps you move by allowing your bones to glide over each other. It also protects bones by preventing them from rubbing against each other. Injured; inflamed; or damaged cartilage can cause symptoms such as pain and limited movement. It can also lead to joint damage and deformity. Causes of cartilage problems include Tears and injuries; such as sports injuriesGenetic factors Other disorders; such as some types of arthritisOsteoarthritis results from breakdown of cartilage.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Kidney Cysts,https://medlineplus.gov/kidneycysts.html, A cyst is a fluid-filled sac. You may get simple kidney cysts as you age; they are usually harmless. There are also some diseases which cause kidney cysts. One type is polycystic kidney disease (PKD). It runs in families. In PKD; many cysts grow in the kidneys. This can enlarge the kidneys and make them work poorly. About half of people with the most common type of PKD end up with kidney failure. PKD also causes cysts in other parts of the body; such as the liver. Often; there are no symptoms at first. Later; symptoms includePain in the back and lower sidesHeadachesBlood in the urineDoctors diagnose PKD with imaging tests and family history. There is no cure. Treatments can help with symptoms and complications. They include medicines and lifestyle changes; and if there is kidney failure; dialysis or kidney transplants.Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) happens in people who have chronic kidney disease; especially if they are on dialysis. Unlike PKD; the kidneys are normal sized; and cysts do not form in other parts of the body. ACKD often has no symptoms. Usually; the cysts are harmless and do not need treatment. If they do cause complications; treatments include medicines; draining the cysts; or surgery.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Kidney Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/kidneydiseases.html,You have two kidneys; each about the size of your fist. They are near the middle of your back; just below the rib cage. Inside each kidney there are about a million tiny structures called nephrons. They filter your blood. They remove wastes and extra water; which become urine.  The urine flows through tubes called ureters. It goes to your bladder; which stores the urine until you go to the bathroom.Most kidney diseases attack the nephrons. This damage may leave kidneys unable to remove wastes. Causes can include genetic problems; injuries; or medicines. You have a higher risk of kidney disease if you have diabetes; high blood pressure; or a close family member with kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease damages the nephrons slowly over several years. Other kidney problems includeCancerCystsStonesInfectionsYour doctor can do blood and urine tests to check if you have kidney disease. If your kidneys fail; you will need dialysis or a kidney transplant.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/polycysticovarysyndrome.html,Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) happens when a woman's ovaries or adrenal glands produce more male hormones than normal.  PCOS causes cysts (fluid-filled sacs) to grow on the ovaries.  Symptoms includeIrregular menstrual periodsInfertilityPelvic painExcess hair growth on the face; chest; stomach; or thighsWeight gainAcne or oily skinPatches of thickened skinWomen with PCOS are at higher risk of diabetes; metabolic syndrome; heart disease; and high blood pressure.PCOS is more common in women who have obesity; or have a mother or sister with PCOS.  To diagnose PCOS; your health care provider may do a physical exam; pelvic exam; blood tests; and an ultrasound.There is no cure; but diet; exercise; and medicines can help control the symptoms. Birth control pills help women have normal periods; reduce male hormone levels; and clear acne. Treatments for infertility caused by PCOS may include medicines; surgery; and in vitro fertilization (IVF).NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Polymyalgia Rheumatica,https://medlineplus.gov/polymyalgiarheumatica.html,Polymyalgia rheumatica is a disorder that causes muscle pain and stiffness in your neck; shoulders; and hips. It is most common in women and almost always occurs in people over 50. The main symptom is stiffness after resting. Other symptoms include fever; weakness and weight loss. In some cases; polymyalgia rheumatica develops overnight. In others; it is gradual.The cause is not known. There is no single test to diagnose polymyalgia rheumatica. Your doctor will use your medical history; symptoms; and a physical exam to make the diagnosis. Lab tests for inflammation may help confirm the diagnosis.Polymyalgia rheumatica sometimes occurs along with giant cell arteritis; a condition that causes swelling of the arteries in your head. Symptoms include headaches and blurred vision.  Doctors often prescribe prednisone; a steroid medicine; for both conditions. With treatment; polymyalgia rheumatica usually disappears in a day or two. Without treatment; it usually goes away after a year or more. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Myositis,https://medlineplus.gov/myositis.html,Myositis means inflammation of the muscles that you use to move your body. An injury; infection; or autoimmune disease can cause it. Two specific kinds are polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Polymyositis causes muscle weakness; usually in the muscles closest to the trunk of your body. Dermatomyositis causes muscle weakness; plus a skin rash.Other symptoms of myositis may includeFatigue after walking or standingTripping or fallingTrouble swallowing or breathingDoctors may use a physical exam; lab tests; imaging tests and a muscle biopsy to diagnose myositis. There is no cure for these diseases; but you can treat the symptoms. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are first treated with high doses of a corticosteroid. Other options include medications; physical therapy; exercise; heat therapy; assistive devices; and rest.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Bowel Movement,https://medlineplus.gov/bowelmovement.html,A bowel movement is the last stop in the movement of food through your digestive tract. Your stool passes out of your body through the rectum and anus.  Another name for stool is feces.  It is made of what is left after your digestive system (stomach; small intestine; and colon) absorbs nutrients and fluids from what you eat and drink.Sometimes a bowel movement isn't normal.  Diarrhea happens when stool passes through the large intestine too quickly. Constipation occurs when stool passes through the large intestine too slowly. Bowel incontinence is a problem controlling your bowel movements. Other abnormalities with bowel movements may be a sign of a digestive problem.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Porphyria,https://medlineplus.gov/porphyria.html,Porphyrias are a group of genetic disorders caused by problems with how your body makes a substance called heme. Heme is found throughout the body; especially in your blood and bone marrow; where it carries oxygen. There are two main types of porphyrias. One affects the skin and the other affects the nervous system. People with the skin type develop blisters; itching; and swelling of their skin when it is exposed to sunlight. The nervous system type is called acute porphyria. Symptoms include pain in the chest; abdomen; limbs; or back; muscle numbness; tingling; paralysis; or cramping; vomiting; constipation; and personality changes or mental disorders. These symptoms come and go.Certain triggers can cause an attack; including some medicines; smoking; drinking alcohol; infections; stress; and sun exposure. Attacks develop over hours or days. They can last for days or weeks. Porphyria can be hard to diagnose. It requires blood; urine; and stool tests. Each type of porphyria is treated differently. Treatment may involve avoiding triggers; receiving heme through a vein; taking medicines to relieve symptoms; or having blood drawn to reduce iron in the body. People who have severe attacks may need to be hospitalized.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Craniofacial Abnormalities,https://medlineplus.gov/craniofacialabnormalities.html,Craniofacial is a medical term that relates to the bones of the skull and face. Craniofacial abnormalities are birth defects of the face or head. Some; like cleft lip and palate; are among the most common of all birth defects. Others are very rare. Most of them affect how a person's face or head looks. These conditions may also affect other parts of the body. Treatment depends on the type of problem. Plastic and reconstructive surgery may help the person's appearance.
Shingles,https://medlineplus.gov/shingles.html,Shingles is a disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus - the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have chickenpox; the virus stays in your body. It may not cause problems for many years.  As you get older; the virus may reappear as shingles. Although it is most common in people over age 50; anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk.You can't catch shingles from someone who has it.  However; if you have a shingles rash; you can pass the virus to someone who has never had chickenpox.  This would usually be a child; who could get chickenpox instead of shingles.  The virus spreads through direct contact with the rash; and cannot spread through the air.Early signs of shingles include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching; usually on one side of the body or face. The pain can be mild to severe. Rashes or blisters appear anywhere from one to 14 days later. If shingles appears on your face; it may affect your vision or hearing. The pain of shingles may last for weeks; months; or even years after the blisters have healed. There is no cure for shingles. Early treatment with medicines that fight the virus may help. These medicines may also help prevent lingering pain.A vaccine may prevent shingles or lessen its effects.  The vaccine is recommended for people 60 or over.  In some cases doctors may give it to people ages 50 to 59.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Polio and Post-Polio Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/polioandpostpoliosyndrome.html,Polio is an infectious disease caused by a virus. The virus lives in an infected person's throat and intestines. It is most often spread by contact with the stool of an infected person. You can also get it from droplets if an infected person sneezes or coughs. It can contaminate food and water if people do not wash their hands.Most people have no symptoms. If you have symptoms; they may include fever; fatigue; nausea; headache; flu-like symptoms; stiff neck and back; and pain in the limbs. A few people will become paralyzed. There is no treatment to reverse the paralysis of polio. Some people who've had polio develop post-polio syndrome (PPS) years later.  Symptoms include tiredness; new muscle weakness; and muscle and joint pain. There is no way to prevent or cure PPS.The polio vaccine has wiped out polio in the United States and most other countries.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,https://medlineplus.gov/posttraumaticstressdisorder.html,Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a real illness. You can get PTSD after living through or seeing a traumatic event; such as war; a hurricane; sexual assault; physical abuse; or a bad accident. PTSD makes you feel stressed and afraid after the danger is over.

Signs of PTSD may start soon after a frightening event and then continue. Other people develop new or more severe signs months or even years later. PTSD can happen to anyone; even children.Treatment may include talk therapy; medicines; or both. Treatment might take 6 to 12 weeks. For some people; it takes longer.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
After Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/aftersurgery.html,After any operation; you'll have some side effects. There is usually some pain with surgery. There may also be swelling and soreness around the area that the surgeon cut.   Your surgeon can tell you which side effects to expect. There can also be complications. These are unplanned events linked to the operation. Some complications are infection; too much bleeding; reaction to anesthesia; or accidental injury. Some people have a greater risk of complications because of other medical conditions. Your surgeon can tell you how you might feel and what you will be able to do - or not do - the first few days; weeks; or months after surgery. Some other questions to ask are  How long you will be in the hospital What kind of supplies; equipment; and help you might need when you go home When you can go back to work When it is ok to start exercising again Are they any other restrictions in your activities  Following your surgeon's advice can help you recover as soon as possible.

Even if you are not breastfeeding; you can have milk leaking from your nipples; and your breasts might feel full; tender; or uncomfortable. Follow your doctor's instructions on how much activity; like climbing stairs or walking; you can do for the next few weeks. Doctors usually recommend that you abstain from sexual intercourse for four to six weeks after birth. In addition to physical changes; you may feel sad or have the "baby blues."  If you are extremely sad or are unable to care for yourself or your baby; you might have a serious condition called postpartum depression.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Postpartum Depression,https://medlineplus.gov/postpartumdepression.html,Many women have the baby blues after childbirth. If you have the baby blues; you may have mood swings; feel sad; anxious or overwhelmed; have crying spells; lose your appetite; or have trouble sleeping. The baby blues most often go away within a few days or a week. The symptoms are not severe and do not need treatment.The symptoms of postpartum depression last longer and are more severe.   You may also feel hopeless and worthless; and lose interest in the baby. You may have thoughts of hurting yourself or the baby. Very rarely; new mothers develop something even more serious. They may have hallucinations or try to hurt themselves or the baby. They need to get treatment right away; often in the hospital.Postpartum depression can begin anytime within the first year after childbirth. The cause is not known.  Hormonal and physical changes after birth and the stress of caring for a new baby may play a role. Women who have had depression are at higher risk.If you think you have postpartum depression; tell your health care provider. Medicines; including antidepressants and talk therapy can help you get well.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Autonomic Nervous System Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/autonomicnervoussystemdisorders.html,Your autonomic nervous system is the part of your nervous system that controls involuntary actions; such as the beating of your heart and the widening or narrowing of your blood vessels. When something goes wrong in this system; it can cause serious problems; including  Blood pressure problems Heart problems Trouble with breathing and swallowing Erectile dysfunction in men  Autonomic nervous system disorders can occur alone or as the result of another disease; such as Parkinson's disease; alcoholism and diabetes. Problems can affect either part of the system; as in complex regional pain syndromes; or all of the system. Some types are temporary; but many worsen over time. When they affect your breathing or heart function; these disorders can be life-threatening. Some autonomic nervous system disorders get better when an underlying disease is treated. Often; however; there is no cure. In that case; the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms.  NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Guide to Good Posture,https://medlineplus.gov/guidetogoodposture.html,Good posture is about more than standing up straight so you can look your best. It is an important part of your long-term health. Making sure that you hold your body the right way; whether you are moving or still; can prevent pain; injuries; and other health problems.What is posture?Posture is how you hold your body. There are two types:Dynamic posture is how you hold yourself when you are moving; like when you are walking; running; or bending over to pick up something.Static posture is how you hold yourself when you are not moving; like when you are sitting; standing; or sleeping.It is important to make sure that you have good dynamic and static posture.The key to good posture is the position of your spine. Your spine has three natural curves - at your neck; mid back; and low back. Correct posture should maintain these curves; but not increase them. Your head should be above your shoulders; and the top of your shoulder should be over the hips.How can posture affect my health?Poor posture can be bad for your health. Slouching or slumping over canMisalign your musculoskeletal systemWear away at your spine; making it more fragile and prone to injuryCause neck; shoulder; and back painDecrease your flexibilityAffect how well your joints moveAffect your balance and increase your risk of fallingMake it harder to digest your foodMake it harder to breatheHow can I improve my posture in general?Be mindful of your posture during everyday activities; like watching television; washing dishes; or walkingStay active. Any kind of exercise may help improve your posture; but certain types of exercises can be especially helpful. They include yoga; tai chi; and other classes that focuses on body awareness. It is also a good idea to do exercises that strengthen your core (muscles around your back; abdomen; and pelvis).Maintain a healthy weight. Extra weight can weaken your abdominal muscles; cause problems for your pelvis and spine; and contribute to low back pain. All of these can hurt your posture.Wear comfortable; low-heeled shoes. High heels; for example; can throw off your balance and force you to walk differently. This puts more stress on your muscles and harms your posture.Make sure work surfaces are at a comfortable height for you; whether you're sitting in front of a computer; making dinner; or eating a meal.How can I improve my posture when sitting?Many Americans spend a lot of their time sitting - either at work; at school; or at home.

They should be bent between 90 and 120 degrees.Make sure that your back is fully supported. Use a back pillow or other back support if your chair does not have a backrest that can support your lower back's curve.Make sure that your thighs and hips are supported. You should have a well-padded seat; and your thighs and hips should be parallel to the floor.How can I improve my posture when standing?Stand up straight and tallKeep your shoulders backPull your stomach inPut your weight mostly on the balls of your feetKeep your head levelLet your arms hang down naturally at your sidesKeep your feet about shoulder-width apartWith practice; you can improve your posture; you will look and feel better.
Potassium,https://medlineplus.gov/potassium.html,Potassium is a mineral that your body needs to work properly. It is a type of electrolyte. It helps your nerves to function and muscles to contract. It helps your heartbeat stay regular. It also helps move nutrients into cells and waste products out of cells. A diet rich in potassium helps to offset some of sodium's harmful effects on blood pressure.Many people get all the potassium they need from what they eat and drink. Sources of potassium in the diet includeLeafy greens; such as spinach and collardsFruit from vines; such as grapes and blackberriesRoot vegetables; such as carrots and potatoesCitrus fruits; such as oranges and grapefruitYour kidneys help to keep the right amount of potassium in your body. If you have chronic kidney disease; your kidneys may not remove extra potassium from the blood. Some medicines also can raise your potassium level. You may need a special diet to lower the amount of potassium that you eat.
Toilet Training,https://medlineplus.gov/toilettraining.html,Is your child ready to use a potty? Children are usually ready around ages 18-24 months. They often signal that they are ready by letting you know when their diapers need changing.You should be prepared to commit to three months of daily encouragement. Successful trips to the potty should be rewarded. Accidents shouldn't get as much attention. Training requires patience. If it is not successful; it may mean your child is not ready.If there are major changes in your family's life; such as moving or having a new baby; it may not be a good time to start potty training.

Prader-Willi Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/praderwillisyndrome.html,Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder. It causes poor muscle tone; low levels of sex hormones and a constant feeling of hunger. The part of the brain that controls feelings of fullness or hunger does not work properly in people with PWS. They overeat; leading to obesity.Babies with PWS are usually floppy; with poor muscle tone; and have trouble sucking. Boys may have undescended testicles. Later; other signs appear. These includeShort staturePoor motor skillsWeight gain Underdeveloped sex organsMild intellectual and learning disabilitiesThere is no cure for PWS. Growth hormone; exercise; and dietary supervision can help build muscle mass and control weight. Other treatments may include sex hormones and behavior therapy. Most people with PWS will need specialized care and supervision throughout their lives.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development

Prediabetes,https://medlineplus.gov/prediabetes.html,Prediabetes means you have blood glucose; or blood sugar; levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Too much glucose in your blood can damage your body over time. If you have prediabetes; you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes; heart disease; and stroke.Most people with prediabetes don't have any symptoms. Your doctor can use an A1C test or another blood test to find out if your blood glucose levels are higher than normal. If you are 45 years old or older; your doctor may recommend that you be tested for prediabetes; especially if you are overweight.Losing weight - at least 5 to 10 percent of your starting weight - can prevent or delay diabetes or even reverse prediabetes. That's 10 to 20 pounds for someone who weighs 200 pounds. You can lose weight by cutting down on the amount of calories and fat you eat and being physically active at least 30 minutes a day. Being physically active makes your body's insulin work better. Your doctor may also prescribe medicine to help control the amount of glucose in your blood.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Steroids,https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html,You may have heard of anabolic steroids; which can have harmful effects. But there's another type of steroid - sometimes called a corticosteroid - that treats a variety of problems. These steroids are similar to hormones that your adrenal glands make to fight stress associated with illnesses and injuries. They reduce inflammation and affect the immune system. You may need to take corticosteroids to treatArthritisAsthmaAutoimmune diseases such as lupus and multiple sclerosisSkin conditions such as eczema and rashesSome kinds of cancerSteroids are strong medicines; and they can have side effects; including weakened bones and cataracts. Because of this; you usually take them for as short a time as possible.
High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/highbloodpressureinpregnancy.html,If you are pregnant; high blood pressure can cause problems for you and your unborn baby. You may have had high blood pressure before you got pregnant. Or you may get it once you are pregnant - a condition called gestational hypertension. Either one can cause low birth weight or premature delivery of the baby.Controlling your blood pressure during pregnancy and getting regular prenatal care are important for the health of you and your baby. Treatments for high blood pressure in pregnancy may include close monitoring of the baby; lifestyle changes; and certain medicines.Some pregnant women with high blood pressure develop preeclampsia. It's a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It can be life-threatening for both you and the unborn baby. There is no proven way to prevent it. Most women who have signs of preeclampsia are closely monitored to lessen or avoid complications. The only way to "cure" preeclampsia is to deliver the baby.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Premature Babies,https://medlineplus.gov/prematurebabies.html,Almost 1 of every 10 infants born in the United States are premature; or preemies. A premature birth is when a baby is born before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. A full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks.Important growth and development happen throughout pregnancy - especially in the final months and weeks. Because they are born too early; preemies weigh much less than full-term babies. They may have health problems because their organs did not have enough time to develop. Problems that a baby born too early may have includeBreathing problemsFeeding difficultiesCerebral palsyDevelopmental delayVision problemsHearing problemsPreemies need special medical care in a neonatal intensive care unit; or NICU.  They stay there until their organ systems can work on their own. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

HIV/AIDS and Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaidsandpregnancy.html,If you are pregnant and have HIV/AIDS;there is a risk of passing HIV to your baby. It can happen in three ways:During pregnancyDuring childbirth; especially if it is vaginal childbirth. In some cases; your doctor may suggest doing a Cesarean section to lower the risk during childbirth.During breastfeedingYou can greatly lower that risk by taking HIV/AIDS medicines. These medicines will also help protect your health. Since some medicines are not safe for babies; it is important to talk with your health care provider about which ones you should take. Then you need to make sure you take your medicines regularly.Your baby will get HIV/AIDS medicines for 4 to 6 weeks after birth. The medicines protect your baby from infection from any HIV that passed from you during childbirth. Your baby will get several tests to check for HIV over the first few months.Some pregnant women with HIV/AIDS may not know that they have it. So it is important that all women who are pregnant or planning to get pregnant have an HIV test as early as possible. Because most pregnant women with HIV/AIDS and their babies take HIV/AIDS medicines; few babies in the United States get HIV.
Diabetes and Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetesandpregnancy.html,Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose; or blood sugar; levels are too high. When you are pregnant; high blood sugar levels are not good for your baby.About seven out of every 100 pregnant women in the United States get gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is diabetes that happens for the first time when a woman is pregnant. Most of the time; it goes away after you have your baby. But it does increase your risk for developing type 2 diabetes later on. Your child is also at risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes.Most women get a test to check for diabetes during their second trimester of pregnancy. Women at higher risk may get a test earlier.If you already have diabetes; the best time to control your blood sugar is before you get pregnant. High blood sugar levels can be harmful to your baby during the first weeks of pregnancy - even before you know you are pregnant. To keep you and your baby healthy; it is important to keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible before and during pregnancy.Either type of diabetes during pregnancy increases the chances of problems for you and your baby. To help lower the chances talk to your health care team aboutA meal plan for your pregnancyA safe exercise planHow often to test your blood sugarTaking your medicine as prescribed. Your medicine plan may need to change during pregnancy.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Health Problems in Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/healthproblemsinpregnancy.html,Every pregnancy has some risk of problems. You may have problems because of a health condition you had before you got pregnant. You could also develop a condition during pregnancy. Other causes of problems during pregnancy can include being pregnant with more than one baby; a health problem in a previous pregnancy; substance abuse during pregnancy; or being over age 35. Any of these can affect your health; the health of your baby; or both.If you have a chronic condition; you should talk to your health care provider about how to minimize your risk before you get pregnant. Once you are pregnant; you may need a health care team to monitor your pregnancy. Some common conditions that can complicate a pregnancy includeHigh blood pressurePolycystic ovary syndromeKidney problemsAutoimmune disordersObesityHIV/AIDSCancer InfectionsOther conditions that can make pregnancy risky can happen while you are pregnant - for example; gestational diabetes and Rh incompatibility.

Pregnancy and Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancyandmedicines.html,Not all medicines are safe to take when you are pregnant. Some medicines can harm your baby. That includes over-the-counter or prescription drugs; herbs; and supplements.Always speak with your health care provider before you start or stop any medicine. Not using medicine that you need may be more harmful to you and your baby than using the medicine. For example; many pregnant women take prescription medicines for health problems like diabetes; asthma; seizures; and heartburn. The decision about whether or not to take a medicine depends on the risks and benefits.  You and your health care provider should make this choice together.Pregnant women should not take regular vitamins. They may have too much or too little of the vitamins that you need. There are special vitamins for pregnant women.  It is important to take 0.4 mg of folic acid every day before you become pregnant through the first part of your pregnancy. Folic acid helps to prevent birth defects of the baby's brain or spine.Food and Drug Administration
Pregnancy and Nutrition,https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancyandnutrition.html,When you're pregnant; eating healthy foods is more important than ever. You need more protein; iron; calcium; and folic acid than you did before pregnancy. You also need more calories. But "eating for two" doesn't mean eating twice as much. It means that the foods you eat are the main source of nutrients for your baby. Sensible; balanced meals will be best for you and your baby.You should gain weight gradually during your pregnancy; with most of the weight gained in the last trimester. Generally; doctors suggest women gain weight at the following rate:2 to 4 pounds total during the first trimester3 to 4 pounds per month for the second and third trimestersMost women need 300 calories a day or more during at least the last six months of pregnancy than they did before they were pregnant. But not all calories are equal. Your baby needs healthy foods that are packed with nutrients - not "empty calories" such as those found in soft drinks; candies; and desserts.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Pregnancy and Substance Abuse,https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancyandsubstanceabuse.html,When you are pregnant; you are not just "eating for two." You also breathe and drink for two; so it is important to carefully consider what you give to your baby.  If you smoke; use alcohol or take illegal drugs; so does your unborn baby.First; don't smoke. Smoking during pregnancy passes nicotine and cancer-causing drugs to your baby. Smoke also keeps your baby from getting nourishment and raises the risk of stillbirth or premature birth. Don't drink alcohol. There is no known safe amount of alcohol a woman can drink while pregnant.  Alcohol can cause life-long physical and behavioral problems in children; including fetal alcohol syndrome.  Don't use illegal drugs. Using illegal drugs may cause underweight babies; birth defects or withdrawal symptoms after birth.If you are pregnant and you smoke; drink alcohol or do drugs; get help.  Your health care provider can recommend programs to help you quit. You and your baby will be better off.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Reproductive Hazards,https://medlineplus.gov/reproductivehazards.html,Both the male and female reproductive systems play a role in pregnancy.  Problems with these systems can affect fertility and the ability to have children.  Something that affects reproductive health is called a reproductive hazard. Examples include:   Radiation Metals such as lead and mercury Chemicals such as pesticides Cigarettes Some viruses Alcohol   For men; a reproductive hazard can affect the sperm. For a woman; a reproductive hazard can cause different effects during pregnancy; depending on when she is exposed. During the first 3 months of pregnancy; it might cause a birth defect or a miscarriage. During the last 6 months of pregnancy; it could slow the growth of the fetus; affect the development of its brain; or cause premature labor.
Miscarriage,https://medlineplus.gov/miscarriage.html,A miscarriage is an unexpected loss of pregnancy before the 20th week of pregnancy. Most miscarriages happen very early in the pregnancy; often before a woman even knows she is pregnant.Factors that may contribute to miscarriage includeA genetic problem with the fetusProblems with the uterus or cervixChronic diseases; such as polycystic ovary syndromeSigns of a miscarriage include vaginal spotting; abdominal pain or cramping; and fluid or tissue passing from the vagina. Bleeding can be a symptom of miscarriage; but many women also have it in early pregnancy and don't miscarry. To be sure; contact your health care provider right away if you have bleeding.Women who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not need any treatment. In some cases; there is tissue left in the uterus. Doctors use a procedure called a dilatation and curettage (D&C) or medicines to remove the tissue.Counseling may help you cope with your grief. Later; if you do decide to try again; work closely with your health care provider to lower the risks. Many women who have a miscarriage go on to have healthy babies.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Stillbirth,https://medlineplus.gov/stillbirth.html,If a woman loses a pregnancy after she's past her 20th week; it's called a stillbirth. Stillbirths are due to natural causes. They can happen before delivery or during delivery. Causes include:Problems with the placenta; the organ that transports oxygen and nutrients to the fetusGenetic problems with the fetusFetal infectionsOther physical problems in the fetusIn at least half of all cases; it is not possible to tell why the baby died.If stillbirth happens before delivery; your health care provider may induce labor or perform a Cesarean section to deliver the fetus.  In some cases; you can wait until you go into labor yourself.  This usually happens within two weeks of stillbirth.Counseling may help you cope with your grief. Later; if you do decide to try again; work closely with your health care provider to lower the risks. Many women who have a stillbirth go on to have healthy babies.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Health Problems in Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/healthproblemsinpregnancy.html,Every pregnancy has some risk of problems. You may have problems because of a health condition you had before you got pregnant. You could also develop a condition during pregnancy. Other causes of problems during pregnancy can include being pregnant with more than one baby; a health problem in a previous pregnancy; substance abuse during pregnancy; or being over age 35. Any of these can affect your health; the health of your baby; or both.If you have a chronic condition; you should talk to your health care provider about how to minimize your risk before you get pregnant. Once you are pregnant; you may need a health care team to monitor your pregnancy. Some common conditions that can complicate a pregnancy includeHigh blood pressurePolycystic ovary syndromeKidney problemsAutoimmune disordersObesityHIV/AIDSCancer InfectionsOther conditions that can make pregnancy risky can happen while you are pregnant - for example; gestational diabetes and Rh incompatibility. Good prenatal care can help detect and treat them.Some discomforts; like nausea; back pain; and fatigue; are common during pregnancy.  Sometimes it is hard to know what is normal. Call your health care provider if something is bothering or worrying you.
Infections and Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/infectionsandpregnancy.html,If you are pregnant; an infection can be more than just a problem for you. Some infections can be dangerous to your baby. You can help yourself avoid infections:Don't eat raw or undercooked meatDon't share food or drinks with other peopleWash your hands frequentlyDon't empty cat litter. Cats can transmit toxoplasmosis.You may need to take medicines or get a vaccine to prevent an infection in your baby. For example; you may need to take antibiotics if you develop an infection with group B strep; or take medicines if you have genital herpes. Only some medicines and vaccines are safe during pregnancy. Ask your health care provider about how best to protect you and your baby.
Teenage Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/teenagepregnancy.html,Most teenage girls don't plan to get pregnant; but many do. Teen pregnancies carry extra health risks to both the mother and the baby. Often; teens don't get prenatal care soon enough; which can lead to problems later on. They have a higher risk for pregnancy-related high blood pressure and its complications. Risks for the baby include premature birth and a low birth weight.If you're a pregnant teen; you can help yourself and your baby byGetting regular prenatal careTaking your prenatal vitamins for your health and to prevent some birth defectsAvoiding smoking; alcohol; and drugsUsing a condom; if you are having sex; to prevent sexually transmitted diseases that could hurt your baby
Premature Babies,https://medlineplus.gov/prematurebabies.html,Almost 1 of every 10 infants born in the United States are premature; or preemies. A premature birth is when a baby is born before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. A full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks.Important growth and development happen throughout pregnancy - especially in the final months and weeks. Because they are born too early; preemies weigh much less than full-term babies. They may have health problems because their organs did not have enough time to develop. Problems that a baby born too early may have includeBreathing problemsFeeding difficultiesCerebral palsyDevelopmental delayVision problemsHearing problemsPreemies need special medical care in a neonatal intensive care unit; or NICU.  They stay there until their organ systems can work on their own. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Preterm Labor,https://medlineplus.gov/pretermlabor.html,Preterm labor is labor that starts before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. It can lead to premature birth. Premature babies may face serious health risks. Symptoms of preterm labor includeContractions every 10 minutes or more oftenLeaking fluid or bleeding from the vaginaFeeling of pressure in the pelvisLow; dull backacheCramps that feel like menstrual crampsAbdominal cramps with or without diarrhea If you think you might be having preterm labor; contact your health care provider. NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Sexual Problems in Men,https://medlineplus.gov/sexualproblemsinmen.html,Many men have sexual problems. They become more common as men age.  Problems can includeErectile dysfunctionReduced or lost interest in sexProblems with ejaculationLow testosteroneStress; illness; medicines; or emotional problems may also be factors.  Occasional problems with sexual function are common. If problems last more than a few months or cause distress for you or your partner; you should see your health care provider.
Childbirth Problems,https://medlineplus.gov/childbirthproblems.html,While childbirth usually goes well; complications can happen.  They can cause a risk to the mother; baby; or both.  Possible complications includePreterm (premature) labor; when labor starts before 37 completed weeks of pregnancyProblems with the umbilical cordProblems with the position of the baby; such as breech; in which the baby is going to come out feet firstBirth injuriesFor some of these problems; the baby may need to be delivered surgically by a Cesarean section.
Preterm Labor,https://medlineplus.gov/pretermlabor.html,Preterm labor is labor that starts before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. It can lead to premature birth. Premature babies may face serious health risks. Symptoms of preterm labor includeContractions every 10 minutes or more oftenLeaking fluid or bleeding from the vaginaFeeling of pressure in the pelvisLow; dull backacheCramps that feel like menstrual crampsAbdominal cramps with or without diarrhea If you think you might be having preterm labor; contact your health care provider. NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Menopause,https://medlineplus.gov/menopause.html,Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her period stops.  It usually occurs naturally; most often after age 45. Menopause happens because the woman's ovaries stop producing the hormones estrogen and progesterone. A woman has reached menopause when she has not had a period for one year.  Changes and symptoms can start several years earlier. They includeA change in periods - shorter or longer; lighter or heavier; with more or less time in between Hot flashes and/or night sweats Trouble sleeping Vaginal dryness Mood swingsTrouble focusingLess hair on head; more on face Some symptoms require treatment.  Talk to your doctor about how to best manage menopause.  Make sure the doctor knows your medical history and your family medical history. This includes whether you are at risk for heart disease; osteoporosis; or breast cancer.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Premature Ovarian Failure,https://medlineplus.gov/prematureovarianfailure.html,Premature ovarian failure (POF) is when a woman's ovaries stop working before she is 40.POF is different from premature menopause. With premature menopause; your periods stop before age 40. You can no longer get pregnant. The cause can be natural or it can be a disease; surgery; chemotherapy; or radiation. With POF; some women still have occasional periods. They may even get pregnant.  In most cases of POF; the cause is unknown.Missed periods are usually the first sign of POF. Later symptoms may be similar to those of natural menopause:Hot flashesNight sweatsIrritabilityPoor concentrationDecreased sex drivePain during sexVaginal drynessDoctors diagnose POF by doing a physical exam and lab and imaging tests.Most women with POF cannot get pregnant naturally. Fertility treatments help a few women; others use donor eggs to have children. There is no treatment that will restore normal ovarian function. However; many health care providers suggest taking hormones until age 50. NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Premenstrual Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/premenstrualsyndrome.html,Premenstrual syndrome; or PMS; is a group of symptoms that start one to two weeks before your period. Most women have at least some symptoms of PMS; and the symptoms go away after their periods start. For some women; the symptoms are severe enough to interfere with their lives. They have a type of PMS called premenstrual dysphoric disorder; or PMDD. Common PMS symptoms include  Breast swelling and tenderness  Acne Bloating and weight gain Pain - headache or joint pain Food cravings  Irritability; mood swings; crying spells; depression   No one knows what causes PMS; but hormonal changes trigger the symptoms. No single PMS treatment works for everyone. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen; aspirin or naproxen may help ease cramps; headaches; backaches and breast tenderness. Exercising; getting enough sleep; and avoiding salt; caffeine; and alcohol can also help. Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Prenatal Care,https://medlineplus.gov/prenatalcare.html,Prenatal care is the health care you get while you are pregnant. It includes your checkups and prenatal testing.  Prenatal care can help keep you and your baby healthy. It lets your health care provider spot health problems early. Early treatment can cure many problems and prevent others.Your doctor or midwife will give you a schedule for your prenatal visits. If you are over 35 years old or your pregnancy is high risk because of health problems like diabetes or high blood pressure; your doctor or midwife will probably want to see you more often. You can also expect to see your health care provider more often as your due date gets closer.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Prenatal Testing,https://medlineplus.gov/prenataltesting.html,Prenatal testing provides information about your baby's health before he or she is born. Some routine tests during pregnancy also check on your health. At your first prenatal visit; your health care provider will test for a number of things; including problems with your blood; signs of infections; and whether you are immune to rubella (German measles) and chickenpox.Throughout your pregnancy; your health care provider may suggest a number of other tests; too. Some tests are suggested for all women; such as screenings for gestational diabetes; Down syndrome; and HIV. Other tests might be offered based on your:AgePersonal or family health historyEthnic backgroundResults of routine testsSome tests are screening tests. They detect risks for or signs of possible health problems in you or your baby. Based on screening test results; your doctor might suggest diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests confirm or rule out health problems in you or your baby. Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
HIV/AIDS Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/hivaidsmedicines.html,In the early 1980s; when the HIV/AIDS epidemic began; patients rarely lived longer than a few years. But today; there are many effective medicines to fight the infection; and people with HIV have longer; healthier lives.There are five major types of medicines:Reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors - interfere with a critical step during the HIV life cycle and keep the virus from making copies of itselfProtease inhibitors - interfere with a protein that HIV uses to make infectious viral particlesFusion inhibitors - block the virus from entering the body's cellsIntegrase inhibitors - block an enzyme HIV needs to make copies of itselfMultidrug combinations - combine two or more different types of drugs into oneThese medicines help people with HIV; but they are not perfect. They do not cure HIV/AIDS. People with HIV infection still have the virus in their bodies. They can still spread HIV to others through unprotected sex and needle sharing; even when they are taking their medicines.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Hearing Disorders and Deafness,https://medlineplus.gov/hearingdisordersanddeafness.html,It's frustrating to be unable to hear well enough to enjoy talking with friends or family. Hearing disorders make it hard; but not impossible; to hear. They can often be helped. Deafness can keep you from hearing sound at all. What causes hearing loss? Some possibilities areHeredityDiseases such as ear infections and meningitis TraumaCertain medicinesLong-term exposure to loud noiseAgingThere are two main types of hearing loss. One happens when your inner ear or auditory nerve is damaged. This type is usually permanent. The other kind happens when sound waves cannot reach your inner ear. Earwax build-up; fluid; or a punctured eardrum can cause it. Treatment or surgery can often reverse this kind of hearing loss.Untreated; hearing problems can get worse. If you have trouble hearing; you can get help. Possible treatments include hearing aids; cochlear implants; special training; certain medicines; and surgery.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Refractive Errors,https://medlineplus.gov/refractiveerrors.html,The cornea and lens of your eye helps you focus.  Refractive errors are vision problems that happen when the shape of the eye keeps you from focusing well. The cause could be the length of the eyeball (longer or shorter); changes in the shape of the cornea; or aging of the lens.Four common refractive errors areMyopia; or nearsightedness - clear vision close up but  blurry in the distanceHyperopia; or farsightedness - clear vision in the distance but blurry close upPresbyopia - inability to focus close up as a result of agingAstigmatism - focus problems caused by the corneaThe most common symptom is blurred vision. Other symptoms may include double vision; haziness; glare or halos around bright lights; squinting; headaches; or eye strain.Glasses or contact lenses can usually correct refractive errors. Laser eye surgery may also be a possibility.NIH: National Eye Institute
Prescription Drug Abuse,https://medlineplus.gov/prescriptiondrugabuse.html,If you take a medicine in a way that is different from what the doctor prescribed; it is called prescription drug abuse. It could beTaking a medicine that was prescribed for someone elseTaking a larger dose than you are supposed toTaking the medicine in a different way than you are supposed to. This might be crushing tablets and then snorting or injecting them.Using the medicine for another purpose; such as getting highAbusing some prescription drugs can lead to addiction. These include opioids; sedatives; tranquilizers; and stimulants.Every medicine has some risk of side effects. Doctors take this into account when prescribing medicines. People who abuse these drugs may not understand the risks. The medicines may not be safe for them; especially at higher doses or when taken with other medicines. NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Pressure Sores,https://medlineplus.gov/pressuresores.html,Pressure sores are areas of damaged skin caused by staying in one position for too long. They commonly form where your bones are close to your skin; such as your ankles; back; elbows; heels and hips. You are at risk if you are bedridden; use a wheelchair; or are unable to change your position. Pressure sores can cause serious infections; some of which are life-threatening. They can be a problem for people in nursing homes. You can prevent the sores by   Keeping skin clean and dry Changing position every two hours Using pillows and products that relieve pressure  Pressure sores have a variety of treatments. Advanced sores are slow to heal; so early treatment is best.
Preterm Labor,https://medlineplus.gov/pretermlabor.html,Preterm labor is labor that starts before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. It can lead to premature birth. Premature babies may face serious health risks. Symptoms of preterm labor includeContractions every 10 minutes or more oftenLeaking fluid or bleeding from the vaginaFeeling of pressure in the pelvisLow; dull backacheCramps that feel like menstrual crampsAbdominal cramps with or without diarrhea If you think you might be having preterm labor; contact your health care provider.

Healthy Living,https://medlineplus.gov/healthyliving.html,Many factors affect your health. Some you cannot control; such as your genetic makeup or your age. But you can make changes to your lifestyle. By taking steps toward healthy living; you can help reduce your risk of heart disease; cancer; stroke and other serious diseases:Get the screening tests you needMaintain a healthy weightEat a variety of healthy foods; and limit calories and saturated fatBe physically activeControl your blood pressure and cholesterolDon't smokeProtect yourself from too much sunDrink alcohol in moderation; or don't drink at allGet enough sleep every dayAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality
Pulmonary Hypertension,https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryhypertension.html,Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs. It is a serious condition. If you have it; the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your lungs become hard and narrow. Your heart has to work harder to pump the blood through. Over time; your heart weakens and cannot do its job and you can develop heart failure. Symptoms of PH  includeShortness of breath during routine activity; such as climbing two flights of stairsTirednessChest painA racing heartbeatPain on the upper right side of the abdomenDecreased appetiteAs PH worsens; you may find it hard to do any physical activities.There are two main kinds of PH. One runs in families or appears for no known reason. The other kind is related to another condition; usually heart or lung disease. There is no cure for PH. Treatments can control symptoms.  They involve treating the heart or lung disease; medicines; oxygen; and sometimes lung transplantation.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/creutzfeldtjakobdisease.html,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare; degenerative brain disorder. Symptoms usually start around age 60. Memory problems; behavior changes; vision problems; and poor muscle coordination progress quickly to dementia; coma; and death. Most patients die within a year.The three main categories of CJD are  Sporadic CJD; which occurs for no known reason Hereditary CJD; which runs in familiesAcquired CJD; which occurs from contact with infected tissue; usually during a medical procedureCattle can get a disease related to CJD called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow disease."  There is concern that people can get a variant of CJD from eating beef from an infected animal; but there is no direct proof to support this.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Degenerative Nerve Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/degenerativenervediseases.html,Degenerative nerve diseases affect many of your body's activities; such as balance; movement; talking; breathing; and heart function.   Many of these diseases are genetic. Sometimes the cause is a medical condition such as alcoholism; a tumor; or a stroke. Other causes may include toxins; chemicals; and viruses.  Sometimes the cause is not known.Degenerative nerve diseases include Alzheimer's disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosisFriedreich's ataxia Huntington's disease Lewy body diseaseParkinson's disease  Spinal muscular atrophyDegenerative nerve diseases can be serious or life-threatening. It depends on the type. Most of them have no cure. Treatments may help improve symptoms; relieve pain; and increase mobility.
Patient Rights,https://medlineplus.gov/patientrights.html,As a patient; you have certain rights.  Some are guaranteed by federal law; such as the right to get a copy of your medical records; and the right to keep them private.  Many states have additional laws protecting patients; and health care facilities often have a patient bill of rights.An important patient right is informed consent.  This means that if you need a treatment; your health care provider must give you the information you need to make a decision.Many hospitals have patient advocates who can help you if you have problems. Many states have an ombudsman office for problems with long term care.  Your state's department of health may also be able to help.
Personal Health Records,https://medlineplus.gov/personalhealthrecords.html,You've probably seen your chart at your doctor's office. In fact; you may have charts at several doctors' offices.  If you've been in the hospital; you have a chart there; too. These charts are your medical records. They may be on paper or electronic. To keep track of all this information; it's a good idea to keep your own personal health record.  What kind of information would you put in a personal health record? You could start withYour name; birth date; blood type; and emergency contact informationDate of last physicalDates and results of tests and screeningsMajor illnesses and surgeries; with datesA list of your medicines and supplements; the dosages; and how long you've taken themAny allergiesAny chronic diseasesAny history of illnesses in your family
Laser Eye Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/lasereyesurgery.html,For many people; laser eye surgery can correct their vision so they no longer need glasses or contact lenses.  Laser eye surgery reshapes the cornea; the clear front part of the eye.  This changes its focusing power. There are different types of laser eye surgery.  LASIK - laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis - is one of the most common. Many patients who have LASIK end up with 20/20 vision. But; like all medical procedures; it has both risks and benefits.  Only your eye doctor can tell if you are a good candidate for laser eye surgery.
Rectal Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/rectaldisorders.html,The rectum is the lower part of your large intestine where your body stores stool. Problems with rectum are common. They include hemorrhoids; abscesses; incontinence and cancer.Many people are embarrassed to talk about rectal troubles. But seeing your doctor about problems in this area is important. This is especially true if you have pain or bleeding. Treatments vary depending on the particular problem.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Genetic Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/geneticdisorders.html,Genes are the building blocks of heredity. They are passed from parent to child. They hold DNA; the instructions for making proteins. Proteins do most of the work in cells. They move molecules from one place to another; build structures; break down toxins; and do many other maintenance jobs.Sometimes there is a mutation; a change in a gene or genes.  The mutation changes the gene's instructions for making a protein; so the protein does not work properly or is missing entirely. This can cause a medical condition called a genetic disorder.You can inherit a gene mutation from one or both parents.  A mutation can also happen during your lifetime.There are three types of genetic disorders:Single-gene disorders; where a mutation affects one gene.  Sickle cell anemia is an example.Chromosomal disorders; where chromosomes (or parts of chromosomes) are missing or changed. Chromosomes are the structures that hold our genes.  Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder.Complex disorders; where there are mutations in two or more genes. Often your lifestyle and environment also play a role.  Colon cancer is an example.Genetic tests on blood and other tissue can identify genetic disorders.NIH: National Library of Medicine
Progressive Supranuclear Palsy,https://medlineplus.gov/progressivesupranuclearpalsy.html,Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare brain disease. It affects brain cells that control the movement of your eyes. This leads to serious and permanent problems with balance and the way you walk. It usually occurs in middle-aged or elderly people. Symptoms are very different in each person; but may include personality changes; speech; vision and swallowing problems. Doctors sometimes confuse PSP with Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.  PSP has no cure and no effective treatments. Walking aids; special glasses and certain medicines might help somewhat. Although the disease gets worse over time; it isn't fatal on its own. However; PSP is dangerous because it increases your risk of pneumonia and choking from swallowing problems and injuries from falling. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Pituitary Tumors,https://medlineplus.gov/pituitarytumors.html,Your pituitary gland is a pea-sized gland at the base of your brain. The pituitary is the "master control gland" - it makes hormones that affect growth and the functions of other glands in the body. Pituitary tumors are common; but often they don't cause health problems. Most people with pituitary tumors never even know they have them. The most common type of pituitary tumor produces hormones and disrupts the balance of hormones in your body. This can cause endocrine diseases such as Cushing's syndrome and hyperthyroidism.Symptoms of pituitary tumors includeHeadaches Vision problemsNausea and vomitingProblems caused by the production of too many hormonesPituitary tumors are usually curable. Treatment is often surgery to remove the tumor. Other options include medicines; radiation therapy; and chemotherapy.
Prostate Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/prostatecancer.html,The prostate is the gland below a man's bladder that produces fluid for semen. Prostate cancer is common among older men. It is rare in men younger than 40. Risk factors for developing prostate cancer include being over 65 years of age; family history; and being African-American.Symptoms of prostate cancer may includeProblems passing urine; such as pain; difficulty starting or stopping the stream; or dribblingLow back painPain with ejaculationTo diagnose prostate cancer; you doctor may do a digital rectal exam to feel the prostate for lumps or anything unusual.  You may also get a blood test for prostate-specific antigen (PSA). These tests are also used in prostate cancer screening; which looks for cancer before you have symptoms. If your results are abnormal; you may need more tests; such as an ultrasound; MRI; or biopsy.Treatment often depends on the stage of the cancer. How fast the cancer grows and how different it is from surrounding tissue helps determine the stage. Men with prostate cancer have many treatment options. The treatment that's best for one man may not be best for another. The options include watchful waiting; surgery; radiation therapy; hormone therapy; and chemotherapy. You may have a combination of treatments.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Prostate Cancer Screening,https://medlineplus.gov/prostatecancerscreening.html,The prostate is the gland below a man's bladder that produces fluid for semen.  Cancer screening is looking for cancer before you have any symptoms. Cancer found early may be easier to treat.There is no standard screening test for prostate cancer. Researchers are studying different tests to find those with the fewest risks and most benefits.  One test is the digital rectal exam (DRE).  The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated; gloved finger into your rectum to feel the prostate for lumps or anything unusual.  Another test is the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test.  Your PSA level may be high if you have prostate cancer.  It can also be high if you have an enlarged prostate (BPH) or other prostate problems.  If your screening results are abnormal; your doctor may do more tests; such as an ultrasound; MRI; or a biopsy.Prostate cancer screening has risks:Finding prostate cancer may not improve your health or help you live longerThe results can sometimes be wrongFollow-up tests; such as a biopsy; may have complicationsYou and your doctor should discuss your risk for prostate cancer; the pros and cons of the screening tests; and whether you should get them.
Prostate Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/prostatediseases.html,The prostate is a gland in men. It helps make semen; the fluid that contains sperm. The prostate surrounds the tube that carries urine away from the bladder and out of the body. A young man's prostate is about the size of a walnut. It slowly grows larger with age. If it gets too large; it can cause problems. This is very common after age 50. The older men get; the more likely they are to have prostate trouble.Some common problems areProstatitis - inflammation; usually caused by bacteriaEnlarged prostate (BPH); or benign prostatic hyperplasia - a common problem in older men which may cause dribbling after urination or a need to go often; especially at nightProstate cancer - a common cancer that responds best to treatment when detected earlyNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Artificial Limbs,https://medlineplus.gov/artificiallimbs.html,People can lose all or part of an arm or leg for a number of reasons. Common ones includeCirculation problems from atherosclerosis or diabetes. They may cause you to need an amputation.Traumatic injuries; including from traffic accidents and military combatCancerBirth defectsIf you are missing an arm or leg; an artificial limb can sometimes replace it.  The device; which is called a prosthesis; can help you to perform daily activities such as walking; eating; or dressing. Some artificial limbs let you function nearly as well as before.
Eye Injuries,https://medlineplus.gov/eyeinjuries.html,The structure of your face helps protect your eyes from injury. Still; injuries can damage your eye; sometimes severely enough that you could lose your vision. Most eye injuries are preventable. If you play sports or work in certain jobs; you may need protection. The most common type of injury happens when something irritates the outer surface of your eye. Certain jobs such as industrial jobs or hobbies such as carpentry make this type of injury more likely. It's also more likely if you wear contact lenses. Chemicals or heat can burn your eyes. With chemicals; the pain may cause you to close your eyes.  This traps the irritant next to the eye and may cause more damage. You should wash out your eye right away while you wait for medical help.
Eye Wear,https://medlineplus.gov/eyewear.html,Eye wear protects or corrects your vision. Examples areSunglassesSafety gogglesGlasses (also called eyeglasses)Contact lensesIf you need corrective lenses; you may be able to choose between contacts or glasses.   Either usually requires a prescription. Almost anyone can wear glasses.  Contact lenses require more careful handling. Many jobs and some sports carry a risk of eye injury. Thousands of children and adults get eye injuries every year. Most are preventable with proper eye protection. Everyone is at risk for eye damage from the sun year-round. It's important to regularly use sunglasses that block out at least 99 percent of UV rays.
Dietary Proteins,https://medlineplus.gov/dietaryproteins.html,Protein is in every cell in the body. Our bodies need protein from the foods we eat to build and maintain bones; muscles and skin. We get proteins in our diet from meat; dairy products; nuts; and certain grains and beans. Proteins from meat and other animal products are complete proteins. This means they supply all of the amino acids the body can't make on its own. Most plant proteins are incomplete. You should eat different types of plant proteins every day to get all of the amino acids your body needs.It is important to get enough dietary protein. You need to eat protein every day; because your body doesn't store it the way it stores fats or carbohydrates.  How much you need depends on your age; sex; health; and level of physical activity. Most Americans eat enough protein in their diet.
Urinalysis,https://medlineplus.gov/urinalysis.html,A urinalysis is a test of your urine. It is often done to check for a urinary tract infections; kidney problems; or diabetes. You may also have one during a checkup; if you are admitted to the hospital; before you have surgery; or if you are pregnant.  It can also monitor some medical conditions and treatments.A urinalysis involves checking the urine forIts colorIts appearance (whether it is clear or cloudy)Any odorThe pH level (acidity)Whether there are substances that are not normally in urine; such as blood; too much protein; glucose; ketones; and bilirubinWhether there are cells; crystals; and casts (tube-shaped proteins)Whether it contains bacteria or other germs
Itching,https://medlineplus.gov/itching.html,Itching is skin tingling or irritation that makes you want to scratch the itchy area. It's a symptom of many health conditions. Common causes are   Allergic reactions  Eczema Dry skin  Insect bites and stings Irritating chemicals Parasites such as pinworms; scabies; head and body lice Pregnancy  Rashes  Reactions to medicines  To soothe itchy skin; you can try cold compresses; lotions and lukewarm baths. Avoid scratching; wearing irritating fabrics and high heat and humidity. Most itching is not serious. However; if you itch all over; have hives that keep coming back or have itching without an apparent cause; you might require medical attention.
Anal Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/analdisorders.html,The anus is the opening of the rectum through which stool passes out of your body. Problems with the anus are common. They include hemorrhoids; abscesses; fissures (cracks); and cancer.You may be embarrassed to talk about your anal troubles. But it is important to let your doctor know; especially if you have pain or bleeding. The more details you can give about your problem; the better your doctor will be able to help you. Treatments vary depending on the particular problem.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Gout,https://medlineplus.gov/gout.html,Gout is a common; painful form of arthritis. It causes swollen; red; hot and stiff joints.Gout happens when uric acid builds up in your body.  Uric acid comes from the breakdown of substances called purines. Purines are in your body's tissues and in foods; such as liver; dried beans and peas; and anchovies. Normally; uric acid dissolves in the blood. It passes through the kidneys and out of the body in urine. But sometimes uric acid can build up and form needle-like crystals. When they form in your joints; it is very painful. The crystals can also cause kidney stones.Often; gout first attacks your big toe. It can also attack ankles; heels; knees; wrists; fingers; and elbows. At first; gout attacks usually get better in days. Eventually; attacks last longer and happen more often.You are more likely to get gout if youAre a manHave family member with goutAre overweightDrink alcoholEat too many foods rich in purinesGout can be hard to diagnose. Your doctor may take a sample of fluid from an inflamed joint to look for crystals. You can treat gout with medicines.Pseudogout has similar symptoms and is sometimes confused with gout.  However; it is caused by calcium phosphate; not uric acid.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Psoriasis,https://medlineplus.gov/psoriasis.html,Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes itchy or sore patches of thick; red skin with silvery scales. You usually get the patches on your elbows; knees; scalp; back; face; palms and feet; but they can show up on other parts of your body.  Some people who have psoriasis also get a form of arthritis called psoriatic arthritis.A problem with your immune system causes psoriasis. In a process called cell turnover; skin cells that grow deep in your skin rise to the surface. Normally; this takes a month. In psoriasis; it happens in just days because your cells rise too fast. Psoriasis can be hard to diagnose because it can look like other skin diseases. Your doctor might need to look at a small skin sample under a microscope.Psoriasis can last a long time; even a lifetime. Symptoms come and go. Things that make them worse includeInfectionsStressDry skinCertain medicinesPsoriasis usually occurs in adults. It sometimes runs in families. Treatments include creams; medicines; and light therapy.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Psoriatic Arthritis,https://medlineplus.gov/psoriaticarthritis.html,Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes itchy or sore patches of thick; red skin with silvery scales. You usually get them on your elbows; knees; scalp; back; face; palms and feet; but they can show up on other parts of your body.Some people with psoriasis have psoriatic arthritis.  It causes pain; stiffness; and swelling of the joints.  It is often mild; but can sometimes be serious and affect many joints. The joint and skin problems don't always happen at the same time.Your doctor will do a physical exam and imaging tests to diagnose psoriatic arthritis. There is no cure; but medicines can help control inflammation and pain. In rare cases; you might need surgery to repair or replace damaged joints.
Mental Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/mentaldisorders.html,Mental disorders include a wide range of problems; including  Anxiety disorders; including panic disorder; obsessive-compulsive disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder; and phobias Bipolar disorder Depression Mood disorders Personality disorders Psychotic disorders; including schizophrenia  There are many causes of mental disorders.  Your genes and family history may play a role. Your life experiences; such as stress or a history of abuse; may also matter. Biological factors can also be part of the cause. A traumatic brain injury can lead to a mental disorder. A mother's exposure to viruses or toxic chemicals while pregnant may play a part.  Other factors may increase your risk; such as use of illegal drugs or having a serious medical condition like cancer. Medications and counseling can help many mental disorders.
Stress,https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html,Everyone feels stressed from time to time. Not all stress is bad. All animals have a stress response; and it can be life-saving. But chronic stress can cause both physical and mental harm.There are at least three different types of stress:Routine stress related to the pressures of work; family; and other daily responsibilitiesStress brought about by a sudden negative change; such as losing a job; divorce; or illnessTraumatic stress; which happens when you are in danger of being seriously hurt or killed. Examples include a major accident; war; assault; or a natural disaster. This type of stress can cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Different people may feel stress in different ways. Some people experience digestive symptoms. Others may have headaches; sleeplessness; depressed mood; anger; and irritability. People under chronic stress get more frequent and severe viral infections; such as the flu or common cold. Vaccines; such as the flu shot; are less effective for them.Some people cope with stress more effectively than others. It's important to know your limits when it comes to stress; so you can avoid more serious health effects.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
Psychotic Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/psychoticdisorders.html,Psychotic disorders are severe mental disorders that cause abnormal thinking and perceptions.

Hallucinations are false perceptions; such as hearing; seeing; or feeling something that is not there.Schizophrenia is one type of psychotic disorder. People with bipolar disorder may also have psychotic symptoms. Other problems that can cause psychosis include alcohol and some drugs; brain tumors; brain infections; and stroke.Treatment depends on the cause of the psychosis. It might involve drugs to control symptoms and talk therapy. Hospitalization is an option for serious cases where a person might be dangerous to himself or others.
Eyelid Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eyeliddisorders.html,Your eyelids help protect your eyes. When you blink; your eyelids spread moisture over your eyes. Blinking also helps move dirt or other particles off the surface of the eye.  You close your eyelids when you see something coming toward your eyes.  This can help protect against injuries.Like most other parts of your body; your eyelids can get infected; inflamed; or even develop cancer. There are also specific eyelid problems; includingEyelids that turn in or outEyelids that droopAbnormal blinking or twitchingTreatment of eyelid problems depends on the cause.
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,https://medlineplus.gov/posttraumaticstressdisorder.html,Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a real illness.

For some people; it takes longer.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
Puberty,https://medlineplus.gov/puberty.html,Puberty is the time in life when a boy or girl becomes sexually mature. It is a process that usually happens between ages 10 and 14 for girls and ages 12 and 16 for boys.  It causes physical changes; and affects boys and girls differently.In girls:The first sign of puberty is usually breast development.Then hair grows in the pubic area and armpits.Menstruation (or a period) usually happens last.In boys:Puberty usually begins with the testicles and penis getting bigger.Then hair grows in the pubic area and armpits.Muscles grow; the voice deepens; and facial hair develops as puberty continues.Both boys and girls may get acne.  They also usually have a growth spurt (a rapid increase in height) that lasts for about 2 or 3 years.  This brings them closer to their adult height; which they reach after puberty.  NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Pulmonary Embolism,https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryembolism.html,A pulmonary embolism is a sudden blockage in a lung artery.  The cause is usually a blood clot in the leg called a deep vein thrombosis that breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lung. Pulmonary embolism is a serious condition that can causePermanent damage to the affected lung Low oxygen levels in your blood Damage to other organs in your body from not getting enough oxygen If a clot is large; or if there are many clots; pulmonary embolism can cause death.  Half the people who have pulmonary embolism have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms; they can include shortness of breath; chest pain or coughing up blood. Symptoms of a blood clot include warmth; swelling; pain; tenderness and redness of the leg. The goal of treatment is to break up clots and help keep other clots from forming.  NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Emphysema,https://medlineplus.gov/emphysema.html,Emphysema is a type of COPD involving damage to the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. As a result; your body does not get the oxygen it needs. Emphysema makes it hard to catch your breath. You may also have a chronic cough and have trouble breathing during exercise.The most common cause is cigarette smoking. If you smoke; quitting can help prevent you from getting the disease.  If you already have emphysema; not smoking might keep it from getting worse. Treatment is based on whether your symptoms are mild; moderate or severe. Treatments include inhalers; oxygen; medications and sometimes surgery to relieve symptoms and prevent complications.
Pulmonary Fibrosis,https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryfibrosis.html,Pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which the tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time.  This tissue gets thick and stiff.  That makes it hard for you to catch your breath; and your blood may not get enough oxygen.Causes of pulmonary fibrosis include environmental pollutants; some medicines; some connective tissue diseases; and interstitial lung disease. Interstitial lung disease is the name for a large group of diseases that inflame or scar the lungs. In most cases; the cause cannot be found.  This is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Symptoms includeShortness of breathA dry; hacking cough that doesn't get betterFatigueWeight loss for no known reasonAching muscles and jointsClubbing; which is the widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toesYour doctor may use your medical history; imaging tests; a biopsy; and lung function tests to diagnose pulmonary fibrosis. There is no cure. Treatments can help with symptoms and improve your quality of life. They include medicines; oxygen therapy; pulmonary rehabilitation; or a lung transplant.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Pulmonary Hypertension,https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryhypertension.html,Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs. It is a serious condition.

Symptoms of PH  includeShortness of breath during routine activity; such as climbing two flights of stairsTirednessChest painA racing heartbeatPain on the upper right side of the abdomenDecreased appetiteAs PH worsens; you may find it hard to do any physical activities.There are two main kinds of PH. One runs in families or appears for no known reason. The other kind is related to another condition; usually heart or lung disease. There is no cure for PH. Treatments can control symptoms.  They involve treating the heart or lung disease; medicines; oxygen; and sometimes lung transplantation.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Pulmonary Rehabilitation,https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryrehabilitation.html,Pulmonary rehabilitation (rehab) is a medically supervised program to help people who have chronic breathing problems; including  COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Sarcoidosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Cystic fibrosis  During pulmonary rehab you may do exercise training and learn breathing techniques. You'll also get tips on conserving your energy and advice on nutrition and coping. These can't cure your lung disease or completely ease your breathing problems. But it can help you function better in your daily life. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Vital Signs,https://medlineplus.gov/vitalsigns.html,Your vital signs show how well your body is functioning. They are usually measured at doctor's offices; often as part of a health checkup; or during an emergency room visit. They includeBlood pressure; which measures the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Blood pressure that is too high or too low can cause problems. Your blood pressure has two numbers. The first number is the pressure when your heart beats and is pumping the blood.  The second is from when your heart is at rest; between beats. A normal blood pressure reading for adults is lower than 120/80 and higher than 90/60.Heart rate; or pulse; which measures how fast your heart is beating. A problem with your heart rate may be an arrhythmia. Your normal heart rate depends on factors such as your age; how much you exercise; whether you are sitting or standing; which medicines you take; and your weight.Respiratory rate; which measures your breathing. Mild breathing changes can be from causes such as a stuffy nose or hard exercise. But slow or fast breathing can also be a sign of a serious breathing problem.Temperature; which measures how hot your body is. A body temperature that is higher than normal (over 98.6 degrees F) is called a fever.
Connective Tissue Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/connectivetissuedisorders.html,Your connective tissue supports many different parts of your body; such as your skin; eyes; and heart. It is like a "cellular glue" that gives your body parts their shape and helps keep them strong. It also helps some of your tissues do their work. It is made of many kinds of proteins. Cartilage and fat are types of connective tissue.Over 200 disorders that impact connective tissue. There are different types:Genetic disorders; such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; Marfan syndrome; and osteogenesis imperfectaAutoimmune disorders; such as lupus and sclerodermaCancers; like some types of soft tissue sarcomaEach disorder has its own symptoms and needs different treatment. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Urinary Tract Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/urinarytractinfections.html,The urinary system is the body's drainage system for removing wastes and extra water.

But about four times as many women get UTIs as men. You're also at higher risk if you have diabetes; need a tube to drain your bladder; or have a spinal cord injury.If you think you have a UTI it is important to see your doctor. Your doctor can tell if you have a UTI with a urine test.  Treatment is with antibiotics. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Fever,https://medlineplus.gov/fever.html,A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal. A normal temperature can vary from person to person; but it is usually around 98.6 F. A fever is not a disease. It is usually a sign that your body is trying to fight an illness or infection.Infections cause most fevers. You get a fever because your body is trying to kill the virus or bacteria that caused the infection. Most of those bacteria and viruses do well when your body is at your normal temperature. But if you have a fever; it is harder for them to survive. Fever also activates your body's immune system.Other causes of fevers includeMedicines; including some antibiotics; blood pressure medicines; and anti-seizure medicinesHeat illnessCancersAutoimmune diseasesSome childhood immunizationsTreatment depends on the cause of your fever. If the fever is very high; your health care provider may recommend taking an over-the-counter medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Adults can also take aspirin; but children with fevers should not take aspirin. It is also important to drink enough liquids; to prevent dehydration.
Bacterial Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/bacterialinfections.html,Bacteria are living things that have only one cell.  Under a microscope; they look like balls; rods; or spirals. They are so small that a line of 1;000 could fit across a pencil eraser. Most bacteria won't hurt you - less than 1 percent of the different types make people sick. Many are helpful. Some bacteria help to digest food; destroy disease-causing cells; and give the body needed vitamins. Bacteria are also used in making healthy foods like yogurt and cheese.But infectious bacteria can make you ill. They reproduce quickly in your body. Many give off chemicals called toxins; which can damage tissue and make you sick. Examples of bacteria that cause infections include Streptococcus; Staphylococcus; and E. coli.Antibiotics are the usual treatment. When you take antibiotics; follow the directions carefully. Each time you take antibiotics; you increase the chances that bacteria in your body will learn to resist them causing antibiotic resistance. Later; you could get or spread an infection that those antibiotics cannot cure.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Health Fraud,https://medlineplus.gov/healthfraud.html,Health fraud involves selling drugs; devices; foods; or cosmetics that have not been proven effective.

Animals with rabies might be aggressive and vicious; or tired and weak  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Radiation Emergencies,https://medlineplus.gov/radiationemergencies.html,Radiation is a type of energy. People are exposed to small amounts of radiation every day from sources such as sunlight. A radiation emergency would involve larger amounts of radiation and could be caused byDirty bombs - a mix of explosives with radioactive powderFallout from a nuclear bombAccidental release from a nuclear reactor or a nuclear weapons plantA lot of radiation over a short period can cause burns or radiation sickness. If the exposure is large enough; it can cause premature aging or even death.Although there are no guarantees of safety during a radiation emergency; you can take actions to protect yourself.  You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear; anxiety and losses. If you do experience a disaster; it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Radiation Exposure,https://medlineplus.gov/radiationexposure.html,Radiation is energy that travels in the form of waves or high-speed particles. It occurs naturally in sunlight. Man-made radiation is used in X-rays; nuclear weapons; nuclear power plants and cancer treatment. If you are exposed to small amounts of radiation over a long time; it raises your risk of cancer. It can also cause mutations in your genes; which you could pass on to any children you have after the exposure. A lot of radiation over a short period; such as from a radiation emergency; can cause burns or radiation sickness. Symptoms of radiation sickness include nausea; weakness; hair loss; skin burns and reduced organ function.  If the exposure is large enough; it can cause premature aging or even death. You may be able to take medicine to reduce the radioactive material in your body. Environmental Protection Agency
Radiation Therapy,https://medlineplus.gov/radiationtherapy.html,Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment. It uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and stop them from spreading. About half of all cancer patients receive it. The radiation may be external; from special machines; or internal; from radioactive substances that a doctor places inside your body. The type of radiation therapy you receive depends on many factors; includingThe type of cancerThe size of the cancerThe cancer's location in the bodyHow close the cancer is to normal tissues that are sensitive to radiationHow far into the body the radiation needs to travelYour general health and medical historyWhether you will have other types of cancer treatmentOther factors; such as your age and other medical conditionsRadiation therapy can damage normal cells as well as cancer cells. Treatment must be carefully planned to minimize side effects. Common side effects include skin changes and fatigue. Other side effects depend on the part of your body being treated.Sometimes radiation is used with other treatments; like surgery or chemotherapy. NIH: National Cancer Institute
X-Rays,https://medlineplus.gov/xrays.html,X-rays are a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves. X-ray imaging creates pictures of the inside of your body. The images show the parts of your body in different shades of black and white. This is because different tissues absorb different amounts of radiation. Calcium in bones absorbs x-rays the most; so bones look white. Fat and other soft tissues absorb less; and look gray. Air absorbs the least; so lungs look black.The most familiar use of x-rays is checking for broken bones; but x-rays are also used in other ways. For example; chest x-rays can spot pneumonia. Mammograms use x-rays to look for breast cancer.When you have an x-ray; you may wear a lead apron to protect certain parts of your body. The amount of radiation you get from an x-ray is small. For example; a chest x-ray gives out a radiation dose similar to the amount of radiation you're naturally exposed to from the environment over 10 days.
Nuclear Scans,https://medlineplus.gov/nuclearscans.html,Nuclear scans use radioactive substances to see structures and functions inside your body. They use a special camera that detects radioactivity.Before the test; you receive a small amount of radioactive material. You may get it as an injection. Sometimes you swallow it or inhale it.   Then you lie still on a table while the camera makes images. Most scans take 20 to 45 minutes.Nuclear scans can help doctors diagnose many conditions; including cancers; injuries; and infections. They can also show how organs like your heart and lungs are working.

Rashes,https://medlineplus.gov/rashes.html,A rash is an area of irritated or swollen skin. Many rashes are itchy; red; painful; and irritated. Some rashes can also lead to blisters or patches of raw skin.  Rashes are a symptom of many different medical problems. Other causes include irritating substances and allergies. Certain genes can make people more likely to get rashes.Contact dermatitis is a common type of rash. It causes redness; itching; and sometimes small bumps. You get the rash where you have touched an irritant; such as a chemical; or something you are allergic to; like poison ivy.Some rashes develop right away. Others form over several days. Although most rashes clear up fairly quickly; others are long-lasting and need  long-term treatment.Because rashes can be caused by many different things; it's important to figure out what kind you have before you treat it. If it is a bad rash; if it does not go away; or if you have other symptoms; you should see your health care provider. Treatments may include moisturizers; lotions; baths; cortisone creams that relieve swelling; and antihistamines; which relieve itching.
Raynaud's Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/raynaudsdisease.html,Raynaud's disease is a rare disorder of the blood vessels; usually in the fingers and toes.  It causes the blood vessels to narrow when you are cold or feeling stressed. When this happens; blood can't get to the surface of the skin and the affected areas turn white and blue. When the blood flow returns; the skin turns red and throbs or tingles. In severe cases; loss of blood flow can cause sores or tissue death. Primary Raynaud's happens on its own. The cause is not known. There is also secondary Raynaud's; which is caused by injuries; other diseases; or certain medicines.People in colder climates are more likely to develop Raynaud's. It is also more common in women; people with a family history; and those over age 30.Treatment for Raynaud's may include drugs to keep the blood vessels open. There are also simple things you can do yourself; such asSoaking hands in warm water at the first sign of an attack Keeping your hands and feet warm in cold weatherAvoiding triggers; such as certain medicines and stressNIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Infectious Arthritis,https://medlineplus.gov/infectiousarthritis.html,Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet; such as your elbow or knee.  Infectious arthritis is an infection in the joint. The infection comes from a bacterial; viral; or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body.  Symptoms of infectious arthritis includeIntense pain in the jointJoint redness and swellingChills and feverInability to move the area with the infected jointOne type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. The reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee; ankle; or toe.  Sometimes; reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder; or in the urethra; which carries urine out of the body. In women; an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. For both men and women; it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. Another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it.To diagnose infectious arthritis; your health care provider may do tests of your blood; urine; and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery.
Learning Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/learningdisorders.html,Learning disorders affect how a person understands; remembers and responds to new information. People with learning disorders may have problems  Listening or paying attention Speaking Reading  or writing Doing math  Although learning disorders occur in very young children; they are usually not recognized until the child reaches school age. About one-third of children who have learning disabilities also have ADHD; which makes it hard to focus.  Evaluation and testing by a trained professional can help identify a learning disorder. The next step is special education; which involves helping your child in the areas where he or she needs the most help. Sometimes tutors or speech or language therapists also work with the children.  Learning disorders do not go away; but strategies to work around them can make them less of a problem. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Sports Safety,https://medlineplus.gov/sportssafety.html,Playing sports can be fun; but it can also be dangerous if you are not careful. You can help prevent injuries byGetting a physical to make sure you are healthy before you start playing your sportWearing the right shoes; gear; and equipment Drinking lots of water Warming up and stretchingIf you have already hurt yourself playing a sport; make sure you recover completely before you start up again.  If possible; protect the injured part of your body with padding; a brace; or special equipment. When you do start playing again; start slowly.
Water Safety (Recreational),https://medlineplus.gov/watersafetyrecreational.html,Playing in the water - whether swimming; boating or diving - can be fun. It can also be dangerous; especially for children. Being safe can help prevent injuries and drowning. To stay safe in the waterAvoid alcohol when swimming or boatingWear a life jacket whenever you're in a boatDon't swim alone; or in bad weatherLearn CPRLearn to swim and teach your children to swimSupervise your children when they are in the waterPrevent sunburns - use plenty of sunscreen
Gastrointestinal Bleeding,https://medlineplus.gov/gastrointestinalbleeding.html,Your digestive or gastrointestinal (GI) tract includes the esophagus; stomach; small intestine; large intestine or colon; rectum; and anus. Bleeding can come from any of these areas. The amount of bleeding can be so small that only a lab test can find it. Signs of bleeding in the digestive tract depend where it is and how much bleeding there is.Signs of bleeding in the upper digestive tract includeBright red blood in vomitVomit that looks like coffee groundsBlack or tarry stoolDark blood mixed with stoolSigns of bleeding in the lower digestive tract includeBlack or tarry stoolDark blood mixed with stoolStool mixed or coated with bright red bloodGI bleeding is not a disease; but a symptom of a disease. There are many possible causes of GI bleeding; including hemorrhoids; peptic ulcers; tears or inflammation in the esophagus; diverticulosis and diverticulitis; ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; colonic polyps; or cancer in the colon; stomach or  esophagus.The test used most often to look for the cause of GI bleeding is called endoscopy. It uses a flexible instrument inserted through the mouth or rectum to view the inside of the GI tract. A type of endoscopy called colonoscopy looks at the large intestine.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Colorectal Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/colorectalcancer.html,The colon and rectum are part of the large intestine. Colorectal cancer occurs when tumors form in the lining of the large intestine. It is common in both men and women. The risk of developing colorectal cancer rises after age 50. You're also more likely to get it if you have colorectal polyps; a family history of colorectal cancer; ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease; eat a diet high in fat; or smoke.Symptoms of colorectal cancer includeDiarrhea or constipationA feeling that your bowel does not empty completelyBlood (either bright red or very dark) in your stoolStools that are narrower than usualFrequent gas pains or cramps; or feeling full or bloatedWeight loss with no known reasonFatigueNausea or vomitingBecause you may not have symptoms at first; it's important to have screening tests. Everyone over 50 should get screened. Tests include colonoscopy and tests for blood in the stool. Treatments for colorectal cancer include surgery; chemotherapy; radiation; or a combination. Surgery can usually cure it when it is found early.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Rectal Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/rectaldisorders.html,The rectum is the lower part of your large intestine where your body stores stool. Problems with rectum are common. They include hemorrhoids; abscesses; incontinence and cancer.Many people are embarrassed to talk about rectal troubles. But seeing your doctor about problems in this area is important. This is especially true if you have pain or bleeding. Treatments vary depending on the particular problem.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/complexregionalpainsyndrome.html,Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition. It causes intense pain; usually in the arms; hands; legs; or feet. It may happen after an injury; either to a nerve or to tissue in the affected area. Rest and time may only make it worse.Symptoms in the affected area areDramatic changes in skin temperature; color; or textureIntense burning painExtreme skin sensitivitySwelling and stiffness in affected jointsDecreased ability to move the affected body partThe cause of CRPS is unknown. There is no specific diagnostic test. Your doctor will diagnose CRPS based on your signs and symptoms.There is no cure. It can get worse over time; and may spread to other parts of the body. Occasionally it goes away; either temporarily or for good. Treatment focuses on relieving the pain; and can include medicines; physical therapy; and nerve blocks.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Reflux in Children,https://medlineplus.gov/refluxinchildren.html,What are reflux (GER) and GERD?The esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. If your child has reflux; his or her stomach contents come back up into the esophagus. Another name for reflux is gastroesophageal reflux (GER).GERD stands for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is a more serious and long-lasting type of reflux. If your child has reflux more than twice a week for a few weeks; it could be GERD.What causes reflux and GERD in children?There is a muscle (the lower esophageal sphincter) that acts as a valve between the esophagus and stomach. When your child swallows; this muscle relaxes to let food pass from the esophagus to the stomach. This muscle normally stays closed; so the stomach contents don't flow back into the esophagus.In children who have reflux and GERD; this muscle becomes weak or relaxes when it shouldn't; and the stomach contents flow back into the esophagus. This can happen because ofA hiatal hernia; a condition in which the upper part of your stomach pushes upward into your chest through an opening in your diaphragmIncreased pressure on the abdomen from being overweight or having obesityMedicines; such as certain asthma medicines; antihistamines (which treat allergies); pain relievers; sedatives (which help put people to sleep); and antidepressantsSmoking or exposure to secondhand smokeA previous surgery on the esophagus or upper abdomenA severe developmental delayCertain neurological conditions; such as cerebral palsyHow common are reflux and GERD in children?Many children have occasional reflux. GERD is not as common; up to 25 percent of children have symptoms of GERD. What are the symptoms of reflux and GERD in children?Your child might not even notice reflux. But some children taste food or stomach acid at the back of the mouth. In children; GERD can causeHeartburn; a painful; burning feeling in the middle of the chest. It is more common in older children (12 years and up).Bad breathNausea and vomitingProblems swallowing or painful swallowingBreathing problemsThe wearing away of teethHow do doctors diagnose reflux and GERD in children?In most cases; a doctor diagnoses reflux by reviewing your child's symptoms and medical history. If the symptoms do not get better with lifestyle changes and anti-reflux medicines; your child may need testing to check for GERD or other problems.Several tests can help a doctor diagnose GERD. Sometimes doctors order more than one test to get a diagnosis. Commonly-used tests includeUpper GI series; which looks at the shape of your child's upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract. You child will drink a contrast liquid called barium. For young children; the barium is mixed in with a bottle or other food. The health care professional will take several x-rays of your child to track the barium as it goes through the esophagus and stomach.Esophageal pH and impedance monitoring; which measures the amount of acid or liquid in your child's esophagus. A doctor or nurse places a thin flexible tube through your child's nose into the stomach. The end of the tube in the esophagus measures when and how much acid comes back up into the esophagus. The other end of the tube attaches to a monitor that records the measurements. Your child will wear the tube for 24 hours. He or she may need to stay in the hospital during the test.Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and biopsy; which uses an endoscope; a long; flexible tube with a light and camera at the end of it. The doctor runs the endoscope down your child's esophagus; stomach; and first part of the small intestine. While looking at the pictures from the endoscope; the doctor may also take tissue samples (biopsy).What lifestyle changes can help treat my child's reflux or GERD?Sometimes reflux and GERD in children can be treated with lifestyle changes:Losing weight; if neededEating smaller mealsAvoiding high-fat foodsWearing loose-fitting clothing around the abdomenStaying upright for 3 hours after meals and not reclining and slouching when sittingSleeping at a slight angle. Raise the head of your child's bed 6 to 8 inches by safely putting blocks under the bedposts.What treatments might the doctor give for my child's GERD?If changes at home do not help enough; the doctor may recommend medicines to treat GERD. The medicines work by lowering the amount of acid in your child's stomach.Some medicines for GERD in children are over-the-counter; and some are prescription medicines. They includeOver-the-counter antacidsH2 blockers; which decrease acid productionProton pump inhibitors (PPIs); which lower the amount of acid the stomach makesProkinetics; which help the stomach empty fasterIf these don't help and your child still has severe symptoms; then surgery might be an option. A pediatric gastroenterologist; a doctor who treats children who have digestive diseases; would do the surgery.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Reflux in Infants,https://medlineplus.gov/refluxininfants.html,What are reflux (GER) and GERD?The esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. If your baby has reflux; his or her stomach contents come back up into the esophagus. Another name for reflux is gastroesophageal reflux (GER).GERD stands for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is a more serious and long-lasting type of reflux. Babies may have GERD if their symptoms prevent them from feeding or if the reflux lasts more than 12 to 14 months.What causes reflux and GERD in infants?There is a muscle (the lower esophageal sphincter) that acts as a valve between the esophagus and stomach. When your baby swallows; this muscle relaxes to let food pass from the esophagus to the stomach. This muscle normally stays closed; so the stomach contents don't flow back into the esophagus.In babies who have reflux; the lower esophageal sphincter muscle is not fully developed and lets the stomach contents back up the esophagus. This causes your baby to spit up (regurgitate). Once his or her sphincter muscle fully develops; your baby should no longer spit up.In babies who have GERD; the sphincter muscle becomes weak or relaxes when it shouldn't. How common are reflux and GERD in infants?Reflux is very common in babies. About half all babies spit up many times a day in the first 3 months of their lives. They usually stop spitting up between the ages of 12 and 14 months.GERD is also common in younger infants. Many 4-month-olds have it. But by their first birthday; only 10 percent of babies still have GERD. What are the symptoms of reflux and GERD in infants?In babies; the main symptom of reflux and GERD is spitting up. GERD may also cause symptoms such asArching of the back; often during or right after eatingColic - crying that lasts for more than 3 hours a day with no medical causeCoughingGagging or trouble swallowingIrritability; especially after eatingPoor eating or refusing to eatPoor weight gain; or weight lossWheezing or trouble breathingForceful or frequent vomitingNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney DiseasesHow do doctors diagnose reflux and GERD in infants?In most cases; a doctor diagnoses reflux by reviewing your baby's symptoms and medical history.

The doctor runs the endoscope down your baby's esophagus; stomach; and first part of the small intestine. While looking at the pictures from the endoscope; the doctor may also take tissue samples (biopsy).What feeding changes can help treat my infant's reflux or GERD?Feeding changes may help your baby's reflux and GERD:Add rice cereal to your baby's bottle of formula or breastmilk. Check with the doctor about how much to add. If the mixture is too thick; you can change the nipple size or cut a little "x" in the nipple to make the opening larger.Burp your baby after every 1 to 2 ounces of formula. If you breastfeed; burp your baby after nursing from each breast.Avoid overfeeding; give your baby the amount of formula or breast milk recommended.Hold your baby upright for 30 minutes after feedings.If you use formula and your doctor thinks that your baby may be sensitive to milk protein; your doctor may suggest switching to a different type of formula. Do not change formulas without talking to the doctor.What treatments might the doctor give for my infant's GERD?If feeding changes do not help enough; the doctor may recommend medicines to treat GERD. The medicines work by lowering the amount of acid in your baby's stomach. The doctor will only suggest medicine if your baby still has regular GERD symptoms andYou already tried some feeding changesYour baby has problems sleeping or feedingYour baby does not grow properlyThe doctor will often prescribe a medicine on a trial basis and will explain any possible complications. You shouldn't give your baby any medicines unless the doctor tells you to.Medicines for GERD in babies includeH2 blockers; which decrease acid productionProton pump inhibitors (PPIs); which lower the amount of acid the stomach makesIf these don't help and your baby still has severe symptoms; then surgery might be an option. Pediatric gastroenterologists only use surgery to treat GERD in babies in rare cases. They may suggest surgery when babies have severe breathing problems or have a physical problem that causes GERD symptoms.
Refractive Errors,https://medlineplus.gov/refractiveerrors.html,The cornea and lens of your eye helps you focus.  Refractive errors are vision problems that happen when the shape of the eye keeps you from focusing well. The cause could be the length of the eyeball (longer or shorter); changes in the shape of the cornea; or aging of the lens.Four common refractive errors areMyopia; or nearsightedness - clear vision close up but  blurry in the distanceHyperopia; or farsightedness - clear vision in the distance but blurry close upPresbyopia - inability to focus close up as a result of agingAstigmatism - focus problems caused by the corneaThe most common symptom is blurred vision. Other symptoms may include double vision; haziness; glare or halos around bright lights; squinting; headaches; or eye strain.Glasses or contact lenses can usually correct refractive errors. Laser eye surgery may also be a possibility.NIH: National Eye Institute
Crohn's Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/crohnsdisease.html,Crohn's disease causes inflammation of the digestive system.  It is one of a group of diseases called inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn's can affect any area from the mouth to the anus. It often affects the lower part of the small intestine called the ileum.The cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. It may be due to an abnormal reaction by the body's immune system.  It also seems to run in some families. It most commonly starts between the ages of 13 and 30.The most common symptoms are pain in the abdomen and diarrhea. Other symptoms includeBleeding from the rectumWeight lossFeverYour doctor will diagnose Crohn's disease with a physical exam; lab tests; imaging tests; and a colonoscopy.Crohn's can cause complications; such as intestinal blockages; ulcers in the intestine; and problems getting enough nutrients. People with Crohn's can also have joint pain and skin problems. Children with the disease may have growth problems.There is no cure for Crohn's. Treatment can help control symptoms; and may include medicines; nutrition supplements; and/or surgery. Some people have long periods of remission; when they are free of symptoms.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Rehabilitation,https://medlineplus.gov/rehabilitation.html,After a serious injury; illness or surgery; you may recover slowly. You may need to regain your strength; relearn skills or find new ways of doing things you did before. This process is rehabilitation.  Rehabilitation often focuses on  Physical therapy to help your strength; mobility and fitness Occupational therapy to help you with your daily activities  Speech-language therapy to help with speaking; understanding; reading; writing and swallowing Treatment of pain  The type of therapy and goals of therapy may be different for different people. An older person who has had a stroke may simply want rehabilitation to be able to dress or bathe without help. A younger person who has had a heart attack may go through cardiac rehabilitation to try  to return to work and normal activities. Someone with a lung disease may get pulmonary rehabilitation to be able to breathe better and improve their quality of life.
Infectious Arthritis,https://medlineplus.gov/infectiousarthritis.html,Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet; such as your elbow or knee.  Infectious arthritis is an infection in the joint. The infection comes from a bacterial; viral; or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body.  Symptoms of infectious arthritis includeIntense pain in the jointJoint redness and swellingChills and feverInability to move the area with the infected jointOne type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. The reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee; ankle; or toe.  Sometimes; reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder; or in the urethra; which carries urine out of the body. In women; an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. For both men and women; it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. Another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it.To diagnose infectious arthritis; your health care provider may do tests of your blood; urine; and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery.
Kidney Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/kidneycancer.html,You have two kidneys. They are fist-sized organs on either side of your backbone above your waist. The tubes inside filter and clean your blood; taking out waste products and making urine.  Kidney cancer forms in the lining of tiny tubes inside your kidneys. Kidney cancer becomes more likely as you age. Risk factors include smoking; having certain genetic conditions; and misusing pain medicines for a long time.You may have no symptoms at first. They may appear as the cancer grows. See your health care provider if you noticeBlood in your urineA lump in your abdomenWeight loss for no reasonPain in your side that does not go awayLoss of appetiteTests to diagnose kidney cancer include blood; urine; and imaging tests. You may also have a biopsy.Treatment depends on your age; your overall health and how advanced the cancer is. It might include surgery; chemotherapy; or radiation; biologic; or targeted therapies.  Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Dialysis,https://medlineplus.gov/dialysis.html,When your kidneys are healthy; they clean your blood. They also make hormones that keep your bones strong and your blood healthy. When your kidneys fail; you need treatment to replace the work your kidneys used to do. Unless you have a kidney transplant; you will need a treatment called dialysis.There are two main types of dialysis. Both types filter your blood to rid your body of harmful wastes; extra salt; and water.Hemodialysis uses a machine. It is sometimes called an artificial kidney. You usually go to a special clinic for treatments several times a week.Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your abdomen; called the peritoneal membrane; to filter your blood.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Kidney Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/kidneydiseases.html,You have two kidneys; each about the size of your fist. They are near the middle of your back; just below the rib cage. Inside each kidney there are about a million tiny structures called nephrons. They filter your blood. They remove wastes and extra water; which become urine.  The urine flows through tubes called ureters. It goes to your bladder; which stores the urine until you go to the bathroom.Most kidney diseases attack the nephrons. This damage may leave kidneys unable to remove wastes. Causes can include genetic problems; injuries; or medicines. You have a higher risk of kidney disease if you have diabetes; high blood pressure; or a close family member with kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease damages the nephrons slowly over several years. Other kidney problems includeCancerCystsStonesInfectionsYour doctor can do blood and urine tests to check if you have kidney disease. If your kidneys fail; you will need dialysis or a kidney transplant.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Kidney Failure,https://medlineplus.gov/kidneyfailure.html,Healthy kidneys clean your blood by removing excess fluid; minerals; and wastes. They also make hormones that keep your bones strong and your blood healthy. But if the kidneys are damaged; they don't work properly. Harmful wastes can build up in your body. Your blood pressure may rise. Your body may retain excess fluid and not make enough red blood cells. This is called kidney failure.If your kidneys fail; you need treatment to replace the work they normally do. The treatment options are dialysis or a kidney transplant. Each treatment has benefits and drawbacks. No matter which treatment you choose; you'll need to make some changes in your life; including how you eat and plan your activities. But with the help of health care providers; family; and friends; most people with kidney failure can lead full and active lives.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Kidney Transplantation,https://medlineplus.gov/kidneytransplantation.html,A kidney transplant is an operation that places a healthy kidney in your body. The transplanted kidney takes over the work of the two kidneys that failed; so you no longer need dialysis. During a transplant; the surgeon places the new kidney in your lower abdomen and connects the artery and vein of the new kidney to your artery and vein. Often; the new kidney will start making urine as soon as your blood starts flowing through it. But sometimes it takes a few weeks to start working. Many transplanted kidneys come from donors who have died. Some come from a living family member. The wait for a new kidney can be long.If you have a transplant; you must take drugs for the rest of your life; to keep your body from rejecting the new kidney.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Ergonomics,https://medlineplus.gov/ergonomics.html,Ergonomics looks at what kind of work you do; what tools you use and your whole job environment.  The aim is to find the best fit between you and your job conditions. Examples of ergonomic changes to your work might includeAdjusting the position of your computer keyboard to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome Being sure that the height of your desk chair allows your feet to rest flat on floorLearning the right way to lift heavy objects to prevent back injuries Using handle coatings or special gloves to suppress vibrations from power toolsMaking sure that you have good posture in whatever you do; whether it is sitting in front of a computer; standing at a checkout; or walking around a warehouseNo matter what the job is; the goal is to make sure that you are safe; comfortable; and less prone to work-related injuries.
Reproductive Hazards,https://medlineplus.gov/reproductivehazards.html,Both the male and female reproductive systems play a role in pregnancy.  Problems with these systems can affect fertility and the ability to have children.  Something that affects reproductive health is called a reproductive hazard. Examples include:   Radiation Metals such as lead and mercury Chemicals such as pesticides Cigarettes Some viruses Alcohol   For men; a reproductive hazard can affect the sperm. For a woman; a reproductive hazard can cause different effects during pregnancy; depending on when she is exposed. During the first 3 months of pregnancy; it might cause a birth defect or a miscarriage. During the last 6 months of pregnancy; it could slow the growth of the fetus; affect the development of its brain; or cause premature labor.
Assisted Living,https://medlineplus.gov/assistedliving.html,Assisted living is for adults who need help with everyday tasks. They may need help with dressing; bathing; eating; or using the bathroom; but they don't need full-time nursing care. Some assisted living facilities are part of retirement communities. Others are near nursing homes; so a person can move easily if needs change.Assisted living costs less than nursing home care. It is still fairly expensive. Older people or their families usually pay for it. Health and long-term care insurance policies may cover some of the costs. Medicare does not cover the costs of assisted living. Administration on Aging
Lung Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/lungdiseases.html,When you breathe; your lungs take in oxygen from the air and deliver it to the bloodstream. The cells in your body need oxygen to work and grow.  During a normal day; you breathe nearly 25;000 times. People with lung disease have difficulty breathing. Millions of people in the U.S. have lung disease. If all types of lung disease are lumped together; it is the number three killer in the United States.The term lung disease refers to many disorders affecting the lungs; such as asthma; COPD; infections like influenza; pneumonia and tuberculosis; lung cancer; and many other breathing problems. Some lung diseases can lead to respiratory failure.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Respiratory Failure,https://medlineplus.gov/respiratoryfailure.html,Respiratory failure happens when not enough oxygen passes from your lungs into your blood. Your body's organs; such as your heart and brain; need oxygen-rich blood to work well. Respiratory failure also can happen if your lungs can't remove carbon dioxide (a waste gas) from your blood. Too much carbon dioxide in your blood can harm your body's organs. Diseases and conditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure. Examples include  Lung diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); pneumonia; pulmonary embolism; and cystic fibrosis Conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing; such as spinal cord injuries; muscular dystrophy and stroke Damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs. An injury to the chest can cause this damage. Drug or alcohol overdose Injuries from inhaling smoke or harmful fumes  Treatment for respiratory failure depends on whether the condition is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) and how severe it is. It also depends on the underlying cause. You may receive oxygen therapy and other treatment to help you breathe. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/respiratorysyncytialvirusinfections.html,Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes mild; cold-like symptoms in adults and older healthy children. It can cause serious problems in young babies; including pneumonia and severe breathing problems. Premature babies and those with other health problems have the highest risk. A child with RSV may have a fever; stuffy nose; cough; and trouble breathing. Lab tests can tell if your child has the virus. There is no specific treatment. You should give your child fluids to prevent dehydration. If needed; you can also give a pain reliever (not aspirin) for fever and headache.RSV easily spreads from person to person.  You can get it from direct contact with someone who has it or by touching infected objects such as toys or surfaces such as  countertops. Washing your hands often and not sharing eating and drinking utensils are simple ways to help prevent the spread of RSV infection. There is currently no vaccine for RSV.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Restless Legs,https://medlineplus.gov/restlesslegs.html,Restless legs syndrome (RLS) causes a powerful urge to move your legs. Your legs become uncomfortable when you are lying down or sitting. Some people describe it as a creeping; crawling; tingling; or burning sensation. Moving makes your legs feel better; but not for long. RLS can make it hard to fall asleep and stay asleep.In most cases; there is no known cause for RLS. In other cases; RLS is caused by a disease or condition; such as anemia or pregnancy. Some medicines can also cause temporary RLS. Caffeine; tobacco; and alcohol may make symptoms worse.Lifestyle changes; such as regular sleep habits; relaxation techniques; and moderate exercise during the day can help.  If those don't work; medicines may reduce the symptoms of RLS.Most people with RLS also have a condition called periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). PLMD is a condition in which a person's legs twitch or jerk uncontrollably; usually during sleep. PLMD and RLS can also affect the arms. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Advance Directives,https://medlineplus.gov/advancedirectives.html,What kind of medical care would you want if you were too ill or hurt to express your wishes? Advance directives are legal documents that allow you to spell out your decisions about end-of-life care ahead of time. They give you a way to tell your wishes to family; friends; and health care professionals and to avoid confusion later on. A living will tells which treatments you want if you are dying or permanently unconscious. You can accept or refuse medical care. You might want to include instructions onThe use of dialysis and breathing machinesIf you want to be resuscitated if your breathing or heartbeat stops Tube feedingOrgan or tissue donation A durable power of attorney for health care is a document that names your health care proxy. Your proxy is someone you trust to make health decisions for you if you are unable to do so. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Retinal Detachment,https://medlineplus.gov/retinaldetachment.html,The retina is a layer of tissue in the back of your eye that senses light and sends images to your brain. It provides the sharp; central vision needed for reading; driving; and seeing fine detail. A retinal detachment lifts or pulls the retina from its normal position.  It can occur at any age; but it is more common in people over age 40. It affects men more than women and whites more than African Americans. A retinal detachment is also more likely to occur in people whoAre extremely nearsightedHave had a retinal detachment in the other eyeHave a family history of retinal detachmentHave had cataract surgeryHave other eye diseases or disordersHave had an eye injurySymptoms include an increase in the number of floaters; which are little "cobwebs" or specks that float about in your field of vision; and/or light flashes in the eye.

If you have any symptoms; see an eye care professional immediately. Treatment includes different types of surgery.NIH: National Eye Institute
Retinal Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/retinaldisorders.html,The retina is a layer of tissue in the back of your eye that senses light and sends images to your brain. In the center of this nerve tissue is the macula. It provides the sharp; central vision needed for reading; driving and seeing fine detail.Retinal disorders affect this vital tissue. They can affect your vision; and some can be serious enough to cause blindness. Examples areMacular degeneration - a disease that destroys your sharp; central visionDiabetic eye diseaseRetinal detachment - a medical emergency; when the retina is pulled away from the back of the eyeRetinoblastoma - cancer of the retina.  It is most common in young children.Macular pucker - scar tissue on the maculaMacular hole -  a small break in the macula that usually happens to people over 60Floaters - cobwebs or specks in your field of visionNIH: National Eye Institute

Symptoms includeLoss of speechLoss of hand movements such as graspingCompulsive movements such as hand wringingBalance problemsBreathing problemsBehavior problemsLearning problems or intellectual disabilityRett syndrome has no cure. You can treat some of the symptoms with medicines; surgery; and physical and speech therapy. Most people with Rett syndrome live into middle age and beyond. They will usually need care throughout their lives.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Reye Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/reyesyndrome.html,Reye syndrome is a rare illness that can affect the blood; liver; and brain of someone who has recently had a viral infection. It always follows another illness. Although it mostly affects children and teens; anyone can get it. It can develop quickly and without warning. It is most common during flu season. Symptoms includeNausea and vomitingListlessness Personality change - such as irritability; combativeness or confusionDelirium Convulsions Loss of consciousnessIf these symptoms occur soon after a viral illness; seek medical attention immediately. Reye syndrome can lead to a coma and brain death; so quick diagnosis and treatment are critical. Treatment focuses on preventing brain damage.  There is no cure.The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown. Studies have shown that taking aspirin increases the risk of getting it. Because of that; health care professionals now recommend other pain relievers for young patients.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Rh Incompatibility,https://medlineplus.gov/rhincompatibility.html,There are four major blood types: A; B; O; and AB. The types are based on substances on the surface of the blood cells. Another blood type is called Rh. Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells.  Most people are Rh-positive; they have Rh factor.  Rh-negative people don't have it.  Rh factor is inherited though genes.When you're pregnant; blood from your baby can cross into your bloodstream; especially during delivery. If you're Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive; your body will react to the baby's blood as a foreign substance.  It will create antibodies (proteins) against the baby's blood. These antibodies usually don't cause problems during a first pregnancy.But Rh incompatibility may cause problems in later pregnancies; if the baby is Rh-positive. This is because the antibodies stay in your body once they have formed.  The antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells.  The baby could get Rh disease; a serious condition that can cause a serious type of anemia.Blood tests can tell whether you have Rh factor and whether your body has made antibodies. Injections of a medicine called Rh immune globulin can keep your body from making Rh antibodies. It helps prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility.  If treatment is needed for the baby; it can include supplements to help the body to make red blood cells and blood transfusions.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

They often are safer than traditional pesticides.Environmental Protection Agency
X-Rays,https://medlineplus.gov/xrays.html,X-rays are a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves. X-ray imaging creates pictures of the inside of your body. The images show the parts of your body in different shades of black and white. This is because different tissues absorb different amounts of radiation. Calcium in bones absorbs x-rays the most; so bones look white. Fat and other soft tissues absorb less; and look gray. Air absorbs the least; so lungs look black.The most familiar use of x-rays is checking for broken bones; but x-rays are also used in other ways. For example; chest x-rays can spot pneumonia. Mammograms use x-rays to look for breast cancer.When you have an x-ray; you may wear a lead apron to protect certain parts of your body. The amount of radiation you get from an x-ray is small. For example; a chest x-ray gives out a radiation dose similar to the amount of radiation you're naturally exposed to from the environment over 10 days.

Herniated Disk,https://medlineplus.gov/herniateddisk.html,Your backbone; or spine; is made up of 26 bones called vertebrae. In between them are soft disks filled with a jelly-like substance. These disks cushion the vertebrae and keep them in place. As you age; the disks break down or degenerate. As they do; they lose their cushioning ability. This can lead to pain if the back is stressed.A herniated disk is a disk that ruptures. This allows the jelly-like center of the disk to leak; irritating the nearby nerves. This can cause sciatica or back pain.Your doctor will diagnose a herniated disk with a physical exam and; sometimes; imaging tests. With treatment; most people recover. Treatments include rest; pain and anti-inflammatory medicines; physical therapy; and sometimes surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Rural Health Concerns,https://medlineplus.gov/ruralhealthconcerns.html,People in rural areas face some different health issues than people who live in towns and cities. Getting health care can be a problem when you live in a remote area.  You might not be able to get to a hospital quickly in an emergency.  You also might not want to travel long distances to get routine checkups and screenings. Rural areas often have fewer doctors and dentists; and certain specialists might not be available at all.  Because it can be hard to get care; health problems in rural residents may be more serious by the time they are diagnosed. People in rural areas of the United States have higher rates of chronic disease than people in urban areas. They also have higher rates of certain types of cancer; from exposure to chemicals used in farming.
Seasonal Affective Disorder,https://medlineplus.gov/seasonalaffectivedisorder.html,Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that comes and goes with the seasons.

Symptoms of SAD may includeSadnessGloomy outlookFeeling hopeless; worthless; and irritableLoss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoyLow energyDifficulty sleeping or oversleepingCarbohydrate cravings and weight gainThoughts of death or suicideSAD is more common in women; young people; and those who live far from the equator. You are also more likely to have SAD if you or your family members have depression.The exact causes of SAD are unknown. Researchers have found that people with SAD may have an imbalance of serotonin; a brain chemical that affects your mood. Their bodies also make too much melatonin; a hormone that regulates sleep; and not enough vitamin D.The main treatment for SAD is light therapy. The idea behind light therapy is to replace the sunshine that you miss during the fall and winter months. You sit in front of a light therapy box every morning to get daily exposure to bright; artificial light. But some people with SAD do not respond to light therapy alone. Antidepressant medicines and talk therapy can reduce SAD symptoms; either alone or combined with light therapy.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health

Sodium,https://medlineplus.gov/sodium.html,Table salt is a combination of two minerals - sodium and chloride Your body needs some sodium to work properly. It helps with the function of nerves and muscles. It also helps to keep the right balance of fluids in your body. Your kidneys control how much sodium is in your body. If you have too much and your kidneys can't get rid it; sodium builds up in your blood. This can lead to high blood pressure. High blood pressure can lead to other health problems.Most people in the U.S. get more sodium in their diets than they need. A key to healthy eating is choosing foods low in sodium. The Dietary Guidelines recommend that most adults eat less than 2.3 grams per day. That equals about 1 teaspoon of table salt a day. Some people are more sensitive to the effects of salt than others and should eat less. This includes people who have high blood pressure; diabetes; or kidney problems; or are African-American or over age 50.

It is more common in the knee and upper arm.Chondrosarcoma - starts in cartilage; usually after age 40Ewing's sarcoma - occurs most often in children and teens under 19. It is more common in boys than girls.The most common symptom of bone cancer is pain. Other symptoms vary; depending on the location and size of the cancer. Surgery is often the main treatment for bone cancer. Other treatments may include amputation; chemotherapy; and radiation therapy. Because bone cancer can come back after treatment; regular follow-up visits are important.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Soft Tissue Sarcoma,https://medlineplus.gov/softtissuesarcoma.html,Your soft tissues connect; support; or surround other tissues. Examples include your muscles; tendons; fat; and blood vessels. Soft tissue sarcoma is a cancer of these soft tissues. There are many kinds; based on the type of tissue they started in. They may cause a lump or swelling in the soft tissue. Sometimes they spread and can press on nerves and organs; causing problems such as pain or trouble breathing.No one knows exactly what causes these cancers. They are not common; but you have a higher risk if you have been exposed to certain chemicals; have had radiation therapy; or have certain genetic diseases.Doctors diagnose soft tissue sarcomas with a biopsy. Treatments include surgery to remove the tumor; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; or a combination.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Coronavirus Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/coronavirusinfections.html,Coronaviruses are common viruses that most people get some time in their life. They are common throughout the world; and they can infect people and animals. Several different coronaviruses can infect people and make them sick. They usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory illness. But; some coronaviruses can cause severe illness.Coronaviruses probably spread through the air by coughing or sneezing; or by close personal contact. If you get infected; symptoms may includeRunny noseCoughSore throatFeverYou may be able to reduce your risk of infection by washing your hands often with soap and water; not touching your eyes; nose; or mouth; and avoiding close contact with people who are sick. There is no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection. There are no specific treatments. You can relieve symptoms with pain and fever medicines and rest.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Cardiac Arrest,https://medlineplus.gov/cardiacarrest.html,The heart has an internal electrical system that controls the rhythm of the heartbeat. Problems can cause abnormal heart rhythms; called arrhythmias. There are many types of arrhythmia. During an arrhythmia; the heart can beat too fast; too slow; or it can stop beating. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurs when the heart develops an arrhythmia that causes it to stop beating. This is different than a heart attack; where the heart usually continues to beat but blood flow to the heart is blocked. There are many possible causes of SCA. They include coronary heart disease; physical stress; and some inherited disorders. Sometimes there is no known cause for the SCA.Without medical attention; the person will die within a few minutes. People are less likely to die if they have early defibrillation. Defibrillation sends an electric shock to restore the heart rhythm to normal. You should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to a person having SCA until defibrillation can be done.If you have had an SCA; an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) reduces the chance of dying from a second SCA.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Scabies,https://medlineplus.gov/scabies.html,Scabies is an itchy skin condition caused by the microscopic mite Sarcoptes scabei. It is common all over the world; and can affect anyone. Scabies spreads quickly in crowded conditions where there is frequent skin-to-skin contact between people. Hospitals; child-care centers; and nursing homes are examples. Scabies can easily infect sex partners and other household members. Sharing clothes; towels; and bedding can sometimes spread scabies.  This can happen much more easily when the infested person has crusted scabies. You cannot get scabies from a pet. Pets get a different mite infection called mange. Symptoms arePimple-like irritations or a rash Intense itching; especially at nightSores caused by scratching Your health care provider diagnoses scabies by looking at the skin rash and finding burrows in the skin.Several lotions are available to treat scabies. The infected person's clothes; bedding and towels should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. Treatment is also recommended for household members and sexual partners.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Shoulder Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/shoulderinjuriesanddisorders.html,Your shoulder joint is composed of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone); the scapula (shoulder blade); and the humerus (upper arm bone). Your shoulders are the most movable joints in your body. They can also be unstable because the ball of the upper arm is larger than the shoulder socket that holds it. To remain in a stable or normal position; the shoulder must be anchored by muscles; tendons; and ligaments.Because your shoulder can be unstable; it can be easily injured. Common problems includeSprains and strainsDislocationsSeparationsTendinitisBursitisTorn rotator cuffsFrozen shoulderFracturesArthritisHealth care providers diagnose shoulder problems by using your medical history; a physical exam; and imaging tests.Often; the first treatment for shoulder problems is RICE. This stands for Rest; Ice; Compression; and Elevation. Other treatments include exercise and medicines to reduce pain and swelling. If those don't work; you may need surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Streptococcal Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/streptococcalinfections.html,Strep is short for Streptococcus; a type of bacteria.   There are two types: group A and group B.Group A strep causesStrep throat - a sore; red throat. Your tonsils may be swollen and have white spots on them.Scarlet fever - an illness that follows strep throat. It causes a red rash on the body.Impetigo - a skin infectionToxic shock syndromeCellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease)Group B strep can cause blood infections; pneumonia and meningitis in newborns. A screening test during pregnancy can tell if you have it. If you do; I.V. antibiotics during labor can save your baby's life.  Adults can also get group B strep infections; especially if they are elderly or already have health problems. Strep B can cause urinary tract infections; blood infections; skin infections and pneumonia in adults.Antibiotics are used to treat strep infections.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Scars,https://medlineplus.gov/scars.html,A scar is a permanent patch of skin that grows over a wound. It forms when your body heals itself after a cut; scrape; burn; or sore. You can also get scars from surgery that cuts through the skin; infections like chickenpox; or skin conditions like acne. Scars are often thicker; as well as pinker; redder; or shinier; than the rest of your skin. How your scar looks depends onHow big and deep your wound isWhere it is How long it takes to heal Your ageYour inherited tendency to scarScars usually fade over time but never go away completely. If the way a scar looks bothers you; various treatments might minimize it. These include surgical revision; dermabrasion; laser treatments; injections; chemical peels; and creams.
Schizophrenia,https://medlineplus.gov/schizophrenia.html,Schizophrenia is a serious brain illness. People who have it may hear voices that aren't there. They may think other people are trying to hurt them. Sometimes they don't make sense when they talk.

Treatment; if needed; depends on the cause of the problem. It may include exercises; medicines; and surgery.
Immune System and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/immunesystemanddisorders.html,Your immune system is a complex network of cells; tissues; and organs that work together to defend against germs. It helps your body to recognize these "foreign" invaders. Then its job is to keep them out; or if it can't; to find and destroy them.If your immune system cannot do its job; the results can be serious. Disorders of the immune system includeAllergy and asthma - immune responses to substances that are usually not harmfulImmune deficiency diseases - disorders in which the immune system is missing one or more of its partsAutoimmune diseases - diseases causing your immune system to attack your own body's cells and tissues by mistakeNIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Scleroderma,https://medlineplus.gov/scleroderma.html,Scleroderma means hard skin. It is a group of diseases that cause abnormal growth of connective tissue.  Connective tissue is the material inside your body that gives your tissues their shape and helps keep them strong. In scleroderma; the tissue gets hard or thick. It can cause swelling or pain in your muscles and joints.Symptoms of scleroderma include Calcium deposits in connective tissues Raynaud's phenomenon; a narrowing of  blood vessels in the hands or feetSwelling of the esophagus; the tube between your throat and stomachThick; tight skin on your fingersRed spots on your hands and face No one knows what causes scleroderma. It is more common in women. It can be mild or severe. Doctors diagnose scleroderma using your medical history; a physical exam; lab tests; and a skin biopsy.

Scoliosis,https://medlineplus.gov/scoliosis.html,Scoliosis causes a sideways curve of your backbone; or spine. These curves are often S- or C-shaped.  Scoliosis is most common in late childhood and the early teens; when children grow fast. Girls are more likely to have it than boys. It can run in families. Symptoms include leaning to one side and having uneven shoulders and hips. Sometimes it is easy to notice; but not always.Children may get screening for scoliosis at school or during a checkup. If it looks like there is a problem; your doctor will use your medical and family history; a physical exam; and imaging tests to make a diagnosis. Treatment depends on your age; how much more you're likely to grow; how much curving there is; and whether the curve is temporary or permanent. People with mild scoliosis might only need checkups to see if the curve is getting worse. Others might need to wear a brace or have surgery. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Health Screening,https://medlineplus.gov/healthscreening.html,Screenings are tests that look for diseases before you have symptoms. Screening tests can find diseases early; when they're easier to treat. You can get some screenings in your doctor's office. Others need special equipment; so you may need to go to a different office or clinic.Some conditions that doctors commonly screen for includeBreast cancer and cervical cancer in womenColorectal cancerDiabetesHigh blood pressureHigh cholesterolOsteoporosisOverweight and obesityProstate cancer in menWhich tests you need depends on your age; your sex; your family history; and whether you have risk factors for certain diseases.

Newborn Screening,https://medlineplus.gov/newbornscreening.html,Your newborn infant has screening tests before leaving the hospital. There may be different tests depending on the state where you live. They includeTests on a few drops of blood from pricking the baby's heel. The tests look for inherited disorders. All states test for at least 30 of these conditions.A hearing test that measures the baby's response to soundA skin test that measures the level of oxygen in the blood. This can tell if the baby has a congenital heart defect.These tests look for serious medical conditions. If not treated; some of these conditions can cause lifelong health problems. Others can cause early death. With early diagnosis; treatment can begin right away; before serious problems can occur or become permanent.If a screening shows that your baby might have a condition; the health care provider or the state health department will call you. It is important to follow up quickly. Further testing can verify whether your baby has the condition. If so; treatment should start right away.

Motion Sickness,https://medlineplus.gov/motionsickness.html,Motion sickness is a common problem in people traveling by car; train; airplanes; and especially boats. Anyone can get it; but it is more common in children; pregnant women; and people taking certain medicines. Motion sickness can start suddenly; with a queasy feeling and cold sweats. It can then lead to dizziness and nausea and vomiting.Your brain senses movement by getting signals from your inner ears; eyes; muscles; and joints. When it gets signals that do not match; you can get motion sickness. For example; if you are reading on your phone while riding a bus; your eyes are focused on something that is not moving; but your inner ear senses motion.Where you sit can make a difference. The front seat of a car; forward cars of a train; upper deck on a boat or wing seats in a plane may give you a smoother ride. Looking out into the distance - instead of trying to read or look at something in the vehicle - can also help. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Seasonal Affective Disorder,https://medlineplus.gov/seasonalaffectivedisorder.html,Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that comes and goes with the seasons.

Symptoms of SAD may includeSadnessGloomy outlookFeeling hopeless; worthless; and irritableLoss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoyLow energyDifficulty sleeping or oversleepingCarbohydrate cravings and weight gainThoughts of death or suicideSAD is more common in women; young people; and those who live far from the equator. You are also more likely to have SAD if you or your family members have depression.The exact causes of SAD are unknown. Researchers have found that people with SAD may have an imbalance of serotonin; a brain chemical that affects your mood. Their bodies also make too much melatonin; a hormone that regulates sleep; and not enough vitamin D.The main treatment for SAD is light therapy. The idea behind light therapy is to replace the sunshine that you miss during the fall and winter months. You sit in front of a light therapy box every morning to get daily exposure to bright; artificial light. But some people with SAD do not respond to light therapy alone. Antidepressant medicines and talk therapy can reduce SAD symptoms; either alone or combined with light therapy.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health

Others can reduce a symptom of a problem or improve some body function. Some surgeries are done to find a problem. For example; a surgeon may do a biopsy; which involves removing a piece of tissue to examine under a microscope. Some surgeries; like heart surgery; can save your life.Some operations that once needed large incisions (cuts in the body) can now be done using much smaller cuts. This is called laparoscopic surgery. Surgeons insert a thin tube with a camera to see; and use small tools to do the surgery.After surgery there can be a risk of complications; including infection; too much bleeding; reaction to anesthesia; or accidental injury. There is almost always some pain with surgery.Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality

Hundreds of those chemicals are toxic and about 70 can cause cancer.Health effects of secondhand smoke includeEar infections in childrenMore frequent and severe asthma attacks in childrenHeart disease and lung cancer in adults who have never smokedThere is no safe amount of secondhand smoke. Even low levels of it can be harmful. The only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke is not to allow smoking indoors.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Seizures,https://medlineplus.gov/seizures.html,Seizures are symptoms of a brain problem. They happen because of sudden; abnormal electrical activity in the brain. When people think of seizures; they often think of convulsions in which a person's body shakes rapidly and uncontrollably. Not all seizures cause convulsions. There are many types of seizures and some have mild symptoms. Seizures fall into two main groups. Focal seizures; also called partial seizures; happen in just one part of the brain. Generalized seizures are a result of abnormal activity on both sides of the brain.  Most seizures last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes and do not cause lasting harm. However; it is a medical emergency if seizures last longer than 5 minutes or if a person has many seizures and does not wake up between them. Seizures can have many causes; including medicines; high fevers; head injuries and certain diseases.  People who have recurring seizures due to a brain disorder have epilepsy.

Minerals,https://medlineplus.gov/minerals.html,Minerals are important for your body to stay healthy. Your body uses minerals for many different jobs; including keeping your bones; muscles; heart; and brain working properly. Minerals are also important for making enzymes and hormones.There are two kinds of minerals: macrominerals and trace minerals. You need larger amounts of macrominerals. They include calcium; phosphorus; magnesium; sodium; potassium; chloride and sulfur. You only need small amounts of trace minerals. They include iron; manganese; copper; iodine; zinc; cobalt; fluoride and selenium. Most people get the amount of minerals they need by eating a wide variety of foods. In some cases; your doctor may recommend a mineral supplement. People who have certain health problems or take some medicines may need to get less of one of the minerals. For example; people with chronic kidney disease need to limit foods that are high in potassium.
Self-harm,https://medlineplus.gov/selfharm.html,Self-harm refers to a person's harming their own body on purpose.  About 1 in 100 people hurts himself or herself in this way.

Their personalities may change. They may become agitated or see things that are not there. Memory loss is a common symptom of dementia. However; memory loss by itself does not mean you have dementia. People with dementia have serious problems with two or more brain functions; such as memory and language. Although dementia is common in very elderly people; it is not part of normal aging.Many different diseases can cause dementia; including Alzheimer's disease and stroke. Drugs are available to treat some of these diseases. While these drugs cannot cure dementia or repair brain damage; they may improve symptoms or slow down the disease.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

Look for trans fat on the labels of processed foods; margarines and shortenings. NIH: National Institute on Aging
Sepsis,https://medlineplus.gov/sepsis.html,Sepsis is a serious illness. It happens when your body has an overwhelming immune response to a bacterial infection.  The chemicals released into the blood to fight the infection trigger widespread inflammation. This leads to blood clots and leaky blood vessels. They cause poor blood flow; which deprives your body's organs of nutrients and oxygen. In severe cases; one or more organs fail. In the worst cases; blood pressure drops and the heart weakens; leading to septic shock.Anyone can get sepsis; but the risk is higher inPeople with weakened immune systemsInfants and childrenThe elderlyPeople with chronic illnesses; such as diabetes; AIDS; cancer; and kidney or liver diseasePeople suffering from a severe burn or physical traumaCommon symptoms of sepsis are fever; chills; rapid breathing and heart rate; rash; confusion; and disorientation. Doctors diagnose sepsis using a blood test to see if the number of white blood cells is abnormal. They also do lab tests that check for signs of infection.People with sepsis are usually treated in hospital intensive care units. Doctors try to treat the infection; sustain the vital organs; and prevent a drop in blood pressure. Many patients receive oxygen and intravenous (IV) fluids. Other types of treatment; such as respirators or kidney dialysis; may be necessary. Sometimes; surgery is needed to clear up an infection.NIH: National Institute of General Medical Sciences
Infectious Arthritis,https://medlineplus.gov/infectiousarthritis.html,Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet; such as your elbow or knee.  Infectious arthritis is an infection in the joint. The infection comes from a bacterial; viral; or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body.  Symptoms of infectious arthritis includeIntense pain in the jointJoint redness and swellingChills and feverInability to move the area with the infected jointOne type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. The reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee; ankle; or toe.  Sometimes; reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder; or in the urethra; which carries urine out of the body. In women; an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. For both men and women; it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. Another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it.To diagnose infectious arthritis; your health care provider may do tests of your blood; urine; and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery.

Shock,https://medlineplus.gov/shock.html,Shock happens when not enough blood and oxygen can get to your organs and tissues.  It causes very low blood pressure and may be life threatening. It often happens along with a serious injury. There are several kinds of shock. Hypovolemic shock happens when you lose a lot of blood or fluids. Causes include internal or external bleeding; dehydration; burns; and severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. Septic shock is caused by infections in the bloodstream. A severe allergic reaction can cause anaphylactic shock. An insect bite or sting might cause it. Cardiogenic shock happens when the heart cannot pump blood effectively.

Water Pollution,https://medlineplus.gov/waterpollution.html,We all need clean water. People need it to grow crops and to operate factories; and for drinking and recreation.  Fish and wildlife depend on it to survive. Many different pollutants can harm our rivers; streams; lakes; and oceans.  The three most common are soil; nutrients; and bacteria. Rain washes soil into streams and rivers. The soil can kill tiny animals and fish eggs. It can clog the gills of fish and block light; causing plants to die. Nutrients; often from fertilizers; cause problems in lakes; ponds; and reservoirs. Nitrogen and phosphorus make algae grow and can turn water green. Bacteria; often from sewage spills; can pollute fresh or salt water. You can help protect your water supply:Don't pour household products such as cleansers; beauty products; medicines; auto fluids; paint; and lawn care products down the drain. Take them to a hazardous waste collection site.Throw away excess household grease (meat fats; lard; cooking oil; shortening; butter; margarine; etc.) diapers; condoms; and personal hygiene products in the garbage can.Clean up after your pets. Pet waste contains nutrients and germs.Environmental Protection Agency
Sepsis,https://medlineplus.gov/sepsis.html,Sepsis is a serious illness. It happens when your body has an overwhelming immune response to a bacterial infection.  The chemicals released into the blood to fight the infection trigger widespread inflammation. This leads to blood clots and leaky blood vessels. They cause poor blood flow; which deprives your body's organs of nutrients and oxygen. In severe cases; one or more organs fail. In the worst cases; blood pressure drops and the heart weakens; leading to septic shock.Anyone can get sepsis; but the risk is higher inPeople with weakened immune systemsInfants and childrenThe elderlyPeople with chronic illnesses; such as diabetes; AIDS; cancer; and kidney or liver diseasePeople suffering from a severe burn or physical traumaCommon symptoms of sepsis are fever; chills; rapid breathing and heart rate; rash; confusion; and disorientation. Doctors diagnose sepsis using a blood test to see if the number of white blood cells is abnormal. They also do lab tests that check for signs of infection.People with sepsis are usually treated in hospital intensive care units. Doctors try to treat the infection; sustain the vital organs; and prevent a drop in blood pressure. Many patients receive oxygen and intravenous (IV) fluids. Other types of treatment; such as respirators or kidney dialysis; may be necessary. Sometimes; surgery is needed to clear up an infection.NIH: National Institute of General Medical Sciences
Coronavirus Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/coronavirusinfections.html,Coronaviruses are common viruses that most people get some time in their life. They are common throughout the world; and they can infect people and animals. Several different coronaviruses can infect people and make them sick. They usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory illness. But; some coronaviruses can cause severe illness.Coronaviruses probably spread through the air by coughing or sneezing; or by close personal contact. If you get infected; symptoms may includeRunny noseCoughSore throatFeverYou may be able to reduce your risk of infection by washing your hands often with soap and water; not touching your eyes; nose; or mouth; and avoiding close contact with people who are sick. There is no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection. There are no specific treatments. You can relieve symptoms with pain and fever medicines and rest.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Immune System and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/immunesystemanddisorders.html,Your immune system is a complex network of cells; tissues; and organs that work together to defend against germs. It helps your body to recognize these "foreign" invaders. Then its job is to keep them out; or if it can't; to find and destroy them.If your immune system cannot do its job; the results can be serious. Disorders of the immune system includeAllergy and asthma - immune responses to substances that are usually not harmfulImmune deficiency diseases - disorders in which the immune system is missing one or more of its partsAutoimmune diseases - diseases causing your immune system to attack your own body's cells and tissues by mistakeNIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

Parkinson's Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/parkinsonsdisease.html,Parkinson's disease (PD) is a type of movement disorder. It happens when nerve cells in the brain don't produce enough of a brain chemical called dopamine. Sometimes it is genetic; but most cases do not seem to run in families. Exposure to chemicals in the environment might play a role.Symptoms begin gradually; often on one side of the body.  Later they affect both sides. They  includeTrembling of hands; arms; legs; jaw and face Stiffness of the arms; legs and trunk Slowness of movement Poor balance and coordination As symptoms get worse; people with the disease may have trouble walking; talking; or doing simple tasks. They may also have problems such as depression; sleep problems; or trouble chewing; swallowing; or speaking.There is no lab test for PD; so it can be difficult to diagnose.  Doctors use a medical history and a neurological examination to diagnose it.PD usually begins around age 60; but it can start earlier. It is more common in men than in women. There is no cure for PD. A variety of medicines sometimes help symptoms dramatically. Surgery and deep brain stimulation (DBS) can help severe cases. With DBS; electrodes are surgically implanted in the brain. They send electrical pulses to stimulate the parts of the brain that control movement.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Food Allergy,https://medlineplus.gov/foodallergy.html,Food allergy is an abnormal response to a food triggered by your body's immune system.In adults; the foods that most often trigger allergic reactions include fish; shellfish; peanuts; and tree nuts; such as walnuts.

Symptoms of food allergy includeItching or swelling in your mouthVomiting; diarrhea; or abdominal cramps and painHives or eczemaTightening of the throat and trouble breathingDrop in blood pressureYour health care provider may use a detailed history; elimination diet; and skin and blood tests to diagnose a food allergy.When you have food allergies; you must be prepared to treat an accidental exposure. Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace; and carry an auto-injector device containing epinephrine (adrenaline).You can only prevent the symptoms of food allergy by avoiding the food. After you and your health care provider have identified the foods to which you are sensitive; you must remove them from your diet.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Shingles,https://medlineplus.gov/shingles.html,Shingles is a disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus - the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have chickenpox; the virus stays in your body. It may not cause problems for many years.  As you get older; the virus may reappear as shingles. Although it is most common in people over age 50; anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk.You can't catch shingles from someone who has it.  However; if you have a shingles rash; you can pass the virus to someone who has never had chickenpox.  This would usually be a child; who could get chickenpox instead of shingles.  The virus spreads through direct contact with the rash; and cannot spread through the air.Early signs of shingles include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching; usually on one side of the body or face. The pain can be mild to severe. Rashes or blisters appear anywhere from one to 14 days later. If shingles appears on your face; it may affect your vision or hearing. The pain of shingles may last for weeks; months; or even years after the blisters have healed. There is no cure for shingles. Early treatment with medicines that fight the virus may help. These medicines may also help prevent lingering pain.A vaccine may prevent shingles or lessen its effects.  The vaccine is recommended for people 60 or over.  In some cases doctors may give it to people ages 50 to 59.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Shock,https://medlineplus.gov/shock.html,Shock happens when not enough blood and oxygen can get to your organs and tissues.  It causes very low blood pressure and may be life threatening. It often happens along with a serious injury. There are several kinds of shock. Hypovolemic shock happens when you lose a lot of blood or fluids. Causes include internal or external bleeding; dehydration; burns; and severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. Septic shock is caused by infections in the bloodstream. A severe allergic reaction can cause anaphylactic shock. An insect bite or sting might cause it. Cardiogenic shock happens when the heart cannot pump blood effectively. This may happen after a heart attack. Neurogenic shock is caused by damage to the nervous system.Symptoms of shock includeConfusion or lack of alertnessLoss of consciousnessSudden and ongoing rapid heartbeatSweatingPale skinA weak pulseRapid breathingDecreased or no urine outputCool hands and feetShock is a life-threatening medical emergency and it is important to get help right away.

Rotator Cuff Injuries,https://medlineplus.gov/rotatorcuffinjuries.html,Your rotator cuff is located in your shoulder area. It is made of muscles and tendons. It helps your shoulder to move and stay stable. Problems with the rotator cuff are common. They include tendinitis; bursitis; and injuries such as tears.Rotator cuff tendons can become inflamed from frequent use or aging. Sometimes they are injured from a fall on an outstretched hand. Sports or jobs with repeated overhead motion can also damage the rotator cuff. Aging causes tendons to wear down; which can lead to a tear. Some tears are not painful; but others can be very painful. Treatment for a torn rotator cuff depends on age; health; how severe the injury is; and how long you've had the torn rotator cuff. Treatment for torn rotator cuff includes:RestHeat or cold to the sore areaMedicines that reduce pain and swellingElectrical stimulation of muscles and nervesUltrasoundCortisone injectionSurgeryNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease
Shoulder Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/shoulderinjuriesanddisorders.html,Your shoulder joint is composed of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone); the scapula (shoulder blade); and the humerus (upper arm bone). Your shoulders are the most movable joints in your body. They can also be unstable because the ball of the upper arm is larger than the shoulder socket that holds it. To remain in a stable or normal position; the shoulder must be anchored by muscles; tendons; and ligaments.Because your shoulder can be unstable; it can be easily injured. Common problems includeSprains and strainsDislocationsSeparationsTendinitisBursitisTorn rotator cuffsFrozen shoulderFracturesArthritisHealth care providers diagnose shoulder problems by using your medical history; a physical exam; and imaging tests.Often; the first treatment for shoulder problems is RICE. This stands for Rest; Ice; Compression; and Elevation. Other treatments include exercise and medicines to reduce pain and swelling. If those don't work; you may need surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Autonomic Nervous System Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/autonomicnervoussystemdisorders.html,Your autonomic nervous system is the part of your nervous system that controls involuntary actions; such as the beating of your heart and the widening or narrowing of your blood vessels. When something goes wrong in this system; it can cause serious problems; including  Blood pressure problems Heart problems Trouble with breathing and swallowing Erectile dysfunction in men  Autonomic nervous system disorders can occur alone or as the result of another disease; such as Parkinson's disease; alcoholism and diabetes. Problems can affect either part of the system; as in complex regional pain syndromes; or all of the system. Some types are temporary; but many worsen over time. When they affect your breathing or heart function; these disorders can be life-threatening. Some autonomic nervous system disorders get better when an underlying disease is treated. Often; however; there is no cure. In that case; the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms.  NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Low Blood Pressure,https://medlineplus.gov/lowbloodpressure.html,You've probably heard that high blood pressure is a problem. Sometimes blood pressure that is too low can also cause problems.Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats; it pumps out blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats; pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest; between beats; your blood pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually they're written one above or before the other; such as 120/80. If your blood pressure reading is 90/60 or lower; you have low blood pressure. Some people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no symptoms and their low readings are normal for them. In other people; blood pressure drops below normal because of a medical condition or certain medicines. Some people may have symptoms of low blood pressure when standing up too quickly.  Low blood pressure is a problem only if it causes dizziness; fainting or in extreme cases; shock.

Sickle Cell Anemia,https://medlineplus.gov/sicklecellanemia.html,Sickle cell anemia is a disease in which your body produces abnormally shaped red blood cells. The cells are shaped like a crescent or sickle. They don't last as long as normal; round red blood cells. This leads to anemia. The sickle cells also get stuck in blood vessels; blocking blood flow. This can cause pain and organ damage.A genetic problem causes sickle cell anemia. People with the disease are born with two sickle cell genes; one from each parent.  If you only have one sickle cell gene; it's called sickle cell trait. About 1 in 12 African Americans has sickle cell trait.The most common symptoms are pain and problems from anemia. Anemia can make you feel tired or weak. In addition; you might have shortness of breath; dizziness; headaches; or coldness in the hands and feet. A blood test can show if you have the trait or anemia.  Most states test newborn babies as part of their newborn screening programs.Sickle cell anemia has no widely available cure. Treatments can help relieve symptoms and lessen complications.  Researchers are investigating new treatments such as blood and marrow stem cell transplants; gene therapy; and new medicines.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/suddeninfantdeathsyndrome.html,Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden; unexplained death of an infant younger than one year old. Some people call SIDS "crib death" because many babies who die of SIDS are found in their cribs. SIDS is the leading cause of death in children between one month and one year old.  Most SIDS deaths occur when babies are between one month and four months old. Premature babies; boys; African Americans; and American Indian/Alaska Native infants have a higher risk of SIDS.Although health care professionals don't know what causes SIDS; they do know ways to reduce the risk. These includePlacing your baby on his or her back to sleep; even for short naps. "Tummy time" is for when babies are awake and someone is watchingHaving your baby sleep in your room for at least the first six months. Your baby should sleep close to you; but on a separate surface designed for infants; such as a crib or bassinet.Using a firm sleep surface; such as a crib mattress covered with a fitted sheet Keeping soft objects and loose bedding away from your baby's sleep areaBreastfeeding your babyMaking sure that your baby doesn't get too hot. Keep the room at a comfortable temperature for an adult.Not smoking during pregnancy or allowing anyone to smoke near your babyNIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Colonoscopy,https://medlineplus.gov/colonoscopy.html,Colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy are procedures that let your doctor look inside your large intestine. They use instruments called scopes.

Sjogren's Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/sjogrenssyndrome.html,Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks parts of your own body by mistake. In Sjogren's syndrome; it attacks the glands that make tears and saliva. This causes a dry mouth and dry eyes. You may have dryness in other places that need moisture; such as your nose; throat; and skin. Sjogren's can also affect other parts of the body; including your joints; lungs; kidneys; blood vessels; digestive organs; and nerves.Most people with Sjogren's syndrome are women. It usually starts after age 40. It is sometimes linked to other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.To make a diagnosis; doctors may use a medical history; physical exam; certain eye and mouth tests; blood tests; and biopsies.Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms. It can differ for each person; it depends on what parts of the body are affected. It may include artificial tears for dye eyes and sucking on sugar-free candy or drinking water often for a dry mouth. Medicines may help with severe symptoms.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Skin Aging,https://medlineplus.gov/skinaging.html,Your skin changes as you age. You might notice wrinkles; age spots and dryness.

Your skinHolds body fluids in; preventing dehydrationKeeps harmful microbes out; preventing infectionsHelps you feel things like heat; cold; and painKeeps your body temperature evenMakes vitamin D when the sun shines on itAnything that irritates; clogs; or inflames your skin can cause symptoms such as redness; swelling; burning; and itching. Allergies; irritants; your genetic makeup; and certain diseases and immune system problems can cause rashes; hives; and other skin conditions. Many skin problems; such as acne; also affect your appearance.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Skin Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/skininfections.html,Your skin helps protect you from germs; but sometimes it can get infected by them.  Some common types of skin infections are  Bacterial: Cellulitis and impetigo. Staphylococcal infections can also affect the skin. Viral: Shingles; warts; and  herpes simplex Fungal: Athlete's foot and yeast infections Parasitic:  Body lice; head lice; and scabies  Treatment of skin infections depends on the cause.
Skin Pigmentation Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/skinpigmentationdisorders.html,Pigmentation means coloring. Skin pigmentation disorders affect the color of your skin. Your skin gets its color from a pigment called melanin. Special cells in the skin make melanin. When these cells become damaged or unhealthy; it affects melanin production. Some pigmentation disorders affect just patches of skin. Others affect your entire body. If your body makes too much melanin; your skin gets darker. Pregnancy; Addison's disease; and sun exposure all can make your skin darker. If your body makes too little melanin; your skin gets lighter. Vitiligo is a condition that causes patches of light skin. Albinism is a genetic condition affecting a person's skin. A person with albinism may have no color; lighter than normal skin color; or patchy missing skin color. Infections; blisters and burns can also cause lighter skin.
Rashes,https://medlineplus.gov/rashes.html,A rash is an area of irritated or swollen skin. Many rashes are itchy; red; painful; and irritated. Some rashes can also lead to blisters or patches of raw skin.  Rashes are a symptom of many different medical problems. Other causes include irritating substances and allergies. Certain genes can make people more likely to get rashes.Contact dermatitis is a common type of rash. It causes redness; itching; and sometimes small bumps. You get the rash where you have touched an irritant; such as a chemical; or something you are allergic to; like poison ivy.Some rashes develop right away. Others form over several days. Although most rashes clear up fairly quickly; others are long-lasting and need  long-term treatment.Because rashes can be caused by many different things; it's important to figure out what kind you have before you treat it. If it is a bad rash; if it does not go away; or if you have other symptoms; you should see your health care provider. Treatments may include moisturizers; lotions; baths; cortisone creams that relieve swelling; and antihistamines; which relieve itching.
Head Injuries,https://medlineplus.gov/headinjuries.html,Chances are you've bumped your head before.  Often; the injury is minor because your skull is hard and it protects your brain.  But other head injuries can be more severe; such as a skull fracture; concussion; or traumatic brain injury.Head injuries can be open or closed.  A closed injury does not break through the skull.  With an open; or penetrating; injury; an object pierces the skull and enters the brain.  Closed injuries are not always less severe than open injuries.Some common causes of head injuries are falls; motor vehicle accidents; violence; and sports injuries.It is important to know the warning signs of a moderate or severe head injury.  Get help immediately if the injured person hasA headache that gets worse or does not go awayRepeated vomiting or nauseaConvulsions or seizuresAn inability to wake upDilated (enlarged) pupil in one or both eyesSlurred speechWeakness or numbness in the arms or legsLoss of coordinationIncreased confusion; restlessness; or agitationDoctors use a neurologic exam and imaging tests to make a diagnosis.

Lupus,https://medlineplus.gov/lupus.html,What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body; including the joints; skin; kidneys; heart; lungs; blood vessels; and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe; and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus; which is rare; affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.Who gets lupus?Anyone can get lupus; but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in Caucasian women. It's also more common in Hispanic; Asian; and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is not known.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms; and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes; most often on the face (also called the "butterfly rash")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms; it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.How do I know if I have lupus?There is no single test to diagnose lupus; and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:Medical historyComplete examBlood testsSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)What are the treatments for lupus?There is no cure for lupus; but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example; if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels; you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.The goals of the treatment plan are toPrevent flaresTreat flares when they occurReduce organ damage and other problemsTreatments may include drugs toReduce swelling and painPrevent or reduce flaresHelp the immune systemReduce or prevent damage to jointsBalance the hormonesBesides taking medicines for lupus; you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol; high blood pressure; or infection.Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time; no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.How can I cope with lupus?It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Sleep Apnea,https://medlineplus.gov/sleepapnea.html,Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes your breathing to stop or get very shallow. Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour.The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However; not everyone who snores has sleep apnea.You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight; male; or have a family history or small airways.  Children with enlarged tonsils or adenoids may also get it.Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories; a physical exam; and sleep study results.When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night; you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes; work-related accidents; and other medical problems. If you have it; it is important to get treatment. Lifestyle changes; mouthpieces; surgery; and breathing devices can treat sleep apnea in many people.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Sleep Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/sleepdisorders.html,Is it hard for you to fall asleep or stay asleep through the night? Do you wake up feeling tired or feel very sleepy during the day; even if you have had enough sleep? You might have a sleep disorder. The most common kinds areInsomnia - a hard time falling or staying asleepSleep apnea - breathing interruptions during sleep Restless legs syndrome - a tingling or prickly sensation in the legs Narcolepsy - daytime "sleep attacks"Nightmares; night terrors; sleepwalking; sleep talking; head banging; wetting the bed and grinding your teeth are kinds of sleep problems called parasomnias.  There are treatments for most sleep disorders.  Sometimes just having good sleep habits can help.
Healthy Sleep,https://medlineplus.gov/healthysleep.html,What is sleep?While you are sleeping; you are unconscious; but your brain and body functions are still active. Sleep is a complex biological process that helps you process new information; stay healthy; and feel rested.During sleep; your brain cycles through five stages: stage 1; 2; 3; 4; and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Different things happen during each stage. For example; you have a different pattern of brain waves during each one. Your breathing; heart; and temperature may be slower or faster in some stages. Certain phases of sleep help you Feel rested and energetic the next dayLearn information; get insight; and form memoriesGive your heart and vascular system a restRelease more growth hormone; which helps children grow. It also boosts muscle mass and the repair of cells and tissues in children and adults.Release sex hormones; which contributes to puberty and fertilityKeep from getting sick or help you get better when you are sick; by creating more cytokines (hormones that help the immune system fight various infections)You need all of the stages to get a healthy sleep.How much sleep do I need?The amount of sleep you need depends on several factors; including your age; lifestyle; health; and whether you have been getting enough sleep recently. The general recommendations for sleep areNewborns: 16-18 hours a dayPreschool-aged children: 11-12 hours a daySchool-aged children: At least 10 hours a dayTeens: 9-10 hours a dayAdults (including the elderly): 7-8 hours a dayDuring puberty; teenagers' biological clocks shift; and they are more likely to go to bed later than younger children and adults; and they tend to want to sleep later in the morning. This delayed sleep-wake rhythm conflicts with the early-morning start times of many high schools and helps explain why most teenagers do not get enough sleep.Some people think that adults need less sleep as they age. But there is no evidence to show that seniors can get by with less sleep than people who are younger. As people age; however; they often get less sleep or they tend to spend less time in the deep; restful stage of sleep. Older people are also more easily awakened.And it's not just the number of hours of sleep you get that matters. The quality of the sleep you get is also important. People whose sleep is frequently interrupted or cut short might not get enough of certain stages of sleep.If you are wondering whether you are getting enough sleep; including quality sleep; ask yourselfDo you have trouble getting up in the morning?Do you have trouble focusing during the day?Do you doze off during the day?If you answered yes to these three questions; you should work on improving your sleep.What are the health effects of not getting enough sleep?Sleep is important for overall health. When you don't get enough sleep (sleep deprivation); it does more than just make you feel tired. It can affect your performance; including your ability to think clearly; react quickly; and form memories. This may cause you to make bad decisions and take more risks. People with sleep deprivation are more likely to get into accidents.Sleep deprivation can also affect your mood; leading toIrritabilityProblems with relationships; especially for children and teenagersDepressionAnxietyIt can also affect your physical health. Research shows that not getting enough sleep; or getting poor-quality sleep; increases your risk ofHigh blood pressureHeart diseaseStrokeKidney diseaseObesityType 2 diabetesNot getting enough sleep can also mean that you don't get enough of the hormones that help children grow and help adults and children build muscle mass; fight infections; and repair cells.Sleep deprivation magnifies the effect of alcohol. A tired person who drinks too much alcohol will be more impaired than a well-rested person.How can I get better sleep?You can take steps to improve your sleep habits. First; make sure that you allow yourself enough time to sleep. With enough sleep each night; you may find that you're happier and more productive during the day.To improve your sleep habits; it also may help toGo to bed and wake up at the same time every dayAvoid caffeine; especially in the afternoon and eveningAvoid nicotineExercise regularly; but don't exercise too late in the dayAvoid alcoholic drinks before bedAvoid large meals and beverages late at nightDon't take a nap after 3 p.m.Relax before bed; for example by taking a bath; reading or listening to relaxing musicKeep the temperature in your bedroom coolGet rid of distractions such as noises; bright lights; and a TV or computer in the bedroom. Also; don't be tempted to go on your phone or tablet just before bed.Get enough sunlight exposure during the dayDon't lie in bed awake; if you can't sleep for 20 minutes; get up and do something relaxingSee a doctor if you have continued trouble sleeping. You may have a sleep disorder; such as insomnia or sleep apnea.  In some cases; your doctor may suggest trying over-the-counter or prescription sleep aid. In other cases; your doctor may want you to do a sleep study; to help diagnose the problem.If you are a shift worker; it can be even harder to get a good sleep. You may also want toTake naps and increase the amount of time available for sleepKeep the lights bright at workLimit shift changes so your body clock can adjustLimit caffeine use to the first part of your shiftRemove sound and light distractions in your bedroom during daytime sleep (for example; use light-blocking curtains)

Herniated Disk,https://medlineplus.gov/herniateddisk.html,Your backbone; or spine; is made up of 26 bones called vertebrae. In between them are soft disks filled with a jelly-like substance. These disks cushion the vertebrae and keep them in place. As you age; the disks break down or degenerate. As they do; they lose their cushioning ability. This can lead to pain if the back is stressed.A herniated disk is a disk that ruptures. This allows the jelly-like center of the disk to leak; irritating the nearby nerves. This can cause sciatica or back pain.Your doctor will diagnose a herniated disk with a physical exam and; sometimes; imaging tests. With treatment; most people recover. Treatments include rest; pain and anti-inflammatory medicines; physical therapy; and sometimes surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Spinal Muscular Atrophy,https://medlineplus.gov/spinalmuscularatrophy.html,Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease that attacks nerve cells; called motor neurons; in the spinal cord. These cells communicate with your voluntary muscles - the ones you can control; like in your arms and legs. As the neurons die; the muscles weaken. This can affect walking; crawling; breathing; swallowing; and head and neck control.SMA runs in families. Parents usually have no symptoms; but still carry the gene. Genetic counseling is important if the disease runs in your family.There are many types of SMA. Some of them are fatal. Some people have a normal life expectancy. It depends on the type and how it affects breathing. There is no cure. Treatments help with symptoms and prevent complications.  They may include machines to help with breathing; nutritional support; physical therapy; and medicines.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Lung Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/lungcancer.html,Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. It is a leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States. Cigarette smoking causes most lung cancers. The more cigarettes you smoke per day and the earlier you started smoking; the greater your risk of lung cancer. High levels of pollution; radiation and asbestos exposure may also increase risk. Common symptoms of lung cancer includeA cough that doesn't go away and gets worse over timeConstant chest painCoughing up bloodShortness of breath; wheezing; or hoarsenessRepeated problems with pneumonia or bronchitisSwelling of the neck and faceLoss of appetite or weight lossFatigueDoctors diagnose lung cancer using a physical exam; imaging; and lab tests. Treatment depends on the type; stage; and how advanced it is. Treatments include surgery; chemotherapy; radiation therapy; and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Birth Weight,https://medlineplus.gov/birthweight.html,Birth weight is the first weight of your baby; taken just after he or she is born.  A low birth weight is less than 5.5 pounds.  A high birth weight is more than 8.8 pounds.A low birth weight baby can be born too small; too early (premature); or both. This can happen for many different reasons.  They include health problems in the mother; genetic factors; problems with the placenta and substance abuse by the mother.Some low birth weight babies may be more at risk for certain health problems. Some may become sick in the first days of life or develop infections. Others may suffer from longer-term problems such as delayed motor and social development or learning disabilities.High birth weight babies are often big because the parents are big; or the mother has diabetes during pregnancy.  These babies may be at a higher risk of birth injuries and problems with blood sugar.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Intestinal Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/intestinalcancer.html,Your small intestine is part of your digestive system.  It is a long tube that connects your stomach to your large intestine. Intestinal cancer is rare; but eating a high-fat diet or having Crohn's disease; celiac disease; or a history of  colonic polyps can increase your risk.Possible signs of small intestine cancer includeAbdominal painWeight loss for no reasonBlood in the stoolA lump in the abdomenImaging tests that create pictures of the small intestine and the area around it can help diagnose intestinal cancer and show whether it has spread.Surgery is the most common treatment. Additional options include chemotherapy; radiation therapy; or a combination.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Small Intestine Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/smallintestinedisorders.html,Your small intestine is the longest part of your digestive system - about twenty feet long!  It connects your stomach to your large intestine (or colon) and folds many times to fit inside your abdomen. Your small intestine does most of the digesting of the foods you eat.  It has three areas called the duodenum; the ileum; and the jejunum. Problems with the small intestine can include:  Bleeding Celiac disease Crohn's disease Infections Intestinal cancer Intestinal obstruction Irritable bowel syndrome Ulcers; such as peptic ulcer  Treatment of disorders of the small intestine depends on the cause.
Smallpox,https://medlineplus.gov/smallpox.html,Smallpox is a disease caused by the Variola major virus. Some experts say that over the centuries it has killed more people than all other infectious diseases combined.  Worldwide immunization stopped the spread of smallpox three decades ago. The last case was reported in 1977. Two research labs still keep small amounts of the virus.  Experts fear bioterrorists could use the virus to spread disease.Smallpox spreads very easily from person to person. Symptoms are flu-like.  They includeHigh feverFatigueHeadacheBackacheA rash with flat red soresThere is no treatment. Fluids and medicines for pain or fever can help control symptoms. Most people recover; but some can die. Those who do recover may have severe scars.The U.S. stopped routine smallpox vaccinations in 1972. Military and other high-risk groups continue to get the vaccine. The U.S. has increased its supply of the vaccine in recent years.  The vaccine makes some people sick; so doctors save it for those at highest risk of disease.  NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Taste and Smell Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/tasteandsmelldisorders.html,Our senses of taste and smell give us great pleasure. Taste helps us enjoy food and beverages. Smell lets us enjoy the scents and fragrances like roses or coffee. Taste and smell also protect us; letting us know when food has gone bad or when there is a gas leak. They make us want to eat; ensuring we get the nutrition we need. People with taste disorders may taste things that aren't there; may not be able to tell the difference in tastes; or can't taste at all. People with smell disorders may lose their sense of smell; or things may smell different.  A smell they once enjoyed may now smell bad to them. Many illnesses and injuries can cause taste and smell disorders; including colds and head injuries. Some drugs can also affect taste and smell. Most people lose some ability to taste and smell as they get older. Treatment varies; depending on the problem and its cause. NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders

If you smell or see smoke; or know that fires are nearby; you should leave the area if you are at greater risk from breathing smoke.Environmental Protection Agency
Smokeless Tobacco,https://medlineplus.gov/smokelesstobacco.html,Many people who chew tobacco or dip snuff think it's safer than smoking. But you don't have to smoke tobacco for it to be dangerous. Chewing or dipping carries risks like  Cancer of the mouth Decay of exposed tooth roots Pulling away of the gums from the teeth White patches or red sores in the mouth that can turn to cancer  Recent research shows the dangers of smokeless tobacco may go beyond the mouth. It might also play a role in other cancers; heart disease and stroke.  Smokeless tobacco contains more nicotine than cigarettes. Nicotine is a highly addictive drug that makes it hard to stop using tobacco once you start. Having a quit date and a quitting plan can help you stop successfully.  NIH: National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research
Smoking,https://medlineplus.gov/smoking.html,There's no way around it. Smoking is bad for your health. Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body. Cigarette smoking causes 87 percent of lung cancer deaths. It is also responsible for many other cancers and health problems. These include lung disease; heart and blood vessel disease; stroke and cataracts. Women who smoke have a greater chance of certain pregnancy problems or having a baby die from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).  Your smoke is also bad for other people - they breathe in your smoke secondhand and can get many of the same problems as smokers do.E-cigarettes often look like cigarettes; but they work differently. They are battery-operated smoking devices. Not much is known about the health risks of using them.Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of health problems. The earlier you quit; the greater the benefit. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Smoking and Youth,https://medlineplus.gov/smokingandyouth.html,Smoking cigarettes has many health risks for everyone. However; the younger you are when you start smoking; the more problems it can cause. People who start smoking before the age of 21 have the hardest time quitting. Teens who smoke are also more likely to use alcohol and illegal drugs.The problem is not just cigarettes.  Spit tobacco; e-cigarettes; and cigars are not safe alternatives to cigarettes. Low-tar and additive-free tobacco products are not safe either.Young people who do not start using tobacco by age 18 will most likely never start.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Quitting Smoking,https://medlineplus.gov/quittingsmoking.html,Tobacco use is the most common preventable cause of death. About half of the people who don't quit smoking will die of smoking-related problems. Quitting smoking is important for your health.Soon after you quit; your circulation begins to improve; and your blood pressure starts to return to normal. Your sense of smell and taste return; and it's easier for you to breathe.  In the long term; giving up tobacco can help you live longer. Your risk of getting cancer decreases with each year you stay smoke-free.Quitting is not easy. You may have short-term affects such as weight gain; irritability; and anxiety. Some people try several times before they succeed. There are many ways to quit smoking. Some people stop "cold turkey."  Others benefit from step-by-step manuals; counseling; or medicines or products that help reduce nicotine addiction. Some people think that switching to e-cigarettes can help you quit smoking; but that has not been proven. Your health care provider can help you find the best way for you to quit.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Pregnancy and Substance Abuse,https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancyandsubstanceabuse.html,When you are pregnant; you are not just "eating for two." You also breathe and drink for two; so it is important to carefully consider what you give to your baby.  If you smoke; use alcohol or take illegal drugs; so does your unborn baby.First; don't smoke. Smoking during pregnancy passes nicotine and cancer-causing drugs to your baby. Smoke also keeps your baby from getting nourishment and raises the risk of stillbirth or premature birth. Don't drink alcohol. There is no known safe amount of alcohol a woman can drink while pregnant.  Alcohol can cause life-long physical and behavioral problems in children; including fetal alcohol syndrome.  Don't use illegal drugs. Using illegal drugs may cause underweight babies; birth defects or withdrawal symptoms after birth.If you are pregnant and you smoke; drink alcohol or do drugs; get help.

If you become anxious and extremely self-conscious in everyday social situations; you could have a social phobia. Other common phobias involve tunnels; highway driving; water; flying; animals and blood. People with phobias try to avoid what they are afraid of. If they cannot; they may experiencePanic and fearRapid heartbeatShortness of breathTremblingA strong desire to get awayPhobias usually start in children or teens; and continue into adulthood. The causes of specific phobias are not known; but they sometimes run in families. Treatment helps most people with phobias. Options include medicines; therapy or both.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
Sodium,https://medlineplus.gov/sodium.html,Table salt is a combination of two minerals - sodium and chloride Your body needs some sodium to work properly. It helps with the function of nerves and muscles. It also helps to keep the right balance of fluids in your body. Your kidneys control how much sodium is in your body. If you have too much and your kidneys can't get rid it; sodium builds up in your blood. This can lead to high blood pressure. High blood pressure can lead to other health problems.Most people in the U.S. get more sodium in their diets than they need. A key to healthy eating is choosing foods low in sodium. The Dietary Guidelines recommend that most adults eat less than 2.3 grams per day. That equals about 1 teaspoon of table salt a day. Some people are more sensitive to the effects of salt than others and should eat less. This includes people who have high blood pressure; diabetes; or kidney problems; or are African-American or over age 50. Reading food labels can help you see how much sodium is in prepared foods.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Soft Tissue Sarcoma,https://medlineplus.gov/softtissuesarcoma.html,Your soft tissues connect; support; or surround other tissues. Examples include your muscles; tendons; fat; and blood vessels. Soft tissue sarcoma is a cancer of these soft tissues. There are many kinds; based on the type of tissue they started in. They may cause a lump or swelling in the soft tissue. Sometimes they spread and can press on nerves and organs; causing problems such as pain or trouble breathing.No one knows exactly what causes these cancers. They are not common; but you have a higher risk if you have been exposed to certain chemicals; have had radiation therapy; or have certain genetic diseases.Doctors diagnose soft tissue sarcomas with a biopsy. Treatments include surgery to remove the tumor; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; or a combination.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Ultrasound,https://medlineplus.gov/ultrasound.html,Ultrasound is a type of imaging. It uses high-frequency sound waves to look at organs and structures inside the body. Health care professionals use it to view the heart; blood vessels; kidneys; liver; and other organs. During pregnancy; doctors use ultrasound to view the fetus. Unlike x-rays; ultrasound does not expose you to radiation.During an ultrasound test; you lie on a table. A special technician or doctor moves a device called a transducer over part of your body. The transducer sends out sound waves; which bounce off the tissues inside your body. The transducer also captures the waves that bounce back. The ultrasound machine creates images from the sound waves.
Sore Throat,https://medlineplus.gov/sorethroat.html,Your throat is a tube that carries food to your esophagus and air to your windpipe and larynx (also called the voice box). The technical name for the throat is pharynx.You can have a sore throat for many reasons.  Often; colds and flu cause sore throats.  Other causes can include:AllergiesMononucleosisSmokingStrep throatTonsillitisTreatment depends on the cause.  Sucking on lozenges; drinking lots of liquids; and gargling may ease the pain.  Over-the-counter pain relievers can also help; but children should not take aspirin.
Chagas Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/chagasdisease.html,Chagas disease is caused by a parasite. It is common in Latin America but not in the United States. Infected blood-sucking bugs; sometimes called kissing bugs; spread it.  When the bug bites you; usually on your face; it leaves behind infected waste. You can get the infection if you rub it in your eyes or nose; the bite wound or a cut. The disease can also spread through contaminated food; a blood transfusion; a donated organ or from mother to baby during pregnancy.If you notice symptoms; they might includeFeverFlu-like symptomsA rashA swollen eyelidThese early symptoms usually go away. However; if you don't treat the infection; it stays in your body. Later; it can cause serious intestinal and heart problems.A physical exam and blood tests can diagnose it.  You may also need tests to see whether the disease has affected your intestines and heart.Medicines can kill the parasite; especially early on. You can also treat related problems. For example; a pacemaker helps with certain heart complications.There are no vaccines or medicines to prevent Chagas disease. If you travel to areas where it occurs; you are at higher risk if you sleep outdoors or in poor housing conditions. It is important to use insecticides to prevent bites; and practice food safety.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Dystonia,https://medlineplus.gov/dystonia.html,Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes involuntary contractions of your muscles. These contractions result in twisting and repetitive movements. Sometimes they are painful.Dystonia can affect just one muscle; a group of muscles or all of your muscles. Symptoms can include tremors; voice problems or a dragging foot. Symptoms often start in childhood. They can also start in the late teens or early adulthood. Some cases worsen over time. Others are mild.Some people inherit dystonia. Others have it because of another disease. Researchers think that dystonia may be due to a problem in the part of the brain that handles messages about muscle contractions. There is no cure. Doctors use medicines; Botox injections; surgery; physical therapy; and other treatments to reduce or eliminate muscle spasms and pain.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Neuromuscular Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/neuromusculardisorders.html,Neuromuscular disorders affect the nerves that control your voluntary muscles. Voluntary muscles are the ones you can control; like in your arms and legs. Your nerve cells; also called neurons; send the messages that control these muscles. When the neurons become unhealthy or die; communication between your nervous system and muscles breaks down. As a result; your muscles weaken and waste away. The weakness can lead to twitching; cramps; aches and pains; and joint and movement problems. Sometimes it also affects heart function and your ability to breathe.Examples of neuromuscular disorders includeAmyotrophic lateral sclerosisMultiple sclerosisMyasthenia gravisSpinal muscular atrophyMany neuromuscular diseases are genetic; which means they run in families or there is a mutation in your genes. Sometimes; an immune system disorder can cause them. Most of them have no cure. The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms; increase mobility and lengthen life.
Learning Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/learningdisorders.html,Learning disorders affect how a person understands; remembers and responds to new information. People with learning disorders may have problems  Listening or paying attention Speaking Reading  or writing Doing math  Although learning disorders occur in very young children; they are usually not recognized until the child reaches school age. About one-third of children who have learning disabilities also have ADHD; which makes it hard to focus.  Evaluation and testing by a trained professional can help identify a learning disorder. The next step is special education; which involves helping your child in the areas where he or she needs the most help. Sometimes tutors or speech or language therapists also work with the children.  Learning disorders do not go away; but strategies to work around them can make them less of a problem. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Speech and Communication Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/speechandcommunicationdisorders.html,Many disorders can affect our ability to speak and communicate. They range from saying sounds incorrectly to being completely unable to speak or understand speech.  Causes includeHearing disorders and deafnessVoice problems; such as dysphonia or those caused by cleft lip or palate Speech problems like stutteringDevelopmental disabilitiesLearning disordersAutism spectrum disorderBrain injuryStrokeSome speech and communication problems may be genetic. Often; no one knows the causes. By first grade; about 5 percent of children have noticeable speech disorders. Speech and language therapy can help. NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Speech and Language Problems in Children,https://medlineplus.gov/speechandlanguageproblemsinchildren.html,Children vary in their development of speech and language skills. Health care professionals have lists of milestones for what's normal. These milestones help figure out whether a child is on track or if he or she may need extra help.  For example; a child usually has one or two words like "Hi;" "dog;" "Dada;" or "Mama" by her first birthday.Sometimes a delay may be caused by hearing loss. Other times it may be due to a speech or language disorder. Children who have speech disorders may have trouble making speech sounds correctly. They may hesitate or stutter when talking. Children with language disorders might have trouble understanding what others say or difficulty sharing their thoughts.  If you have concerns about your child's speech or language development; talk to your child's health care provider. NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Assisted Reproductive Technology,https://medlineplus.gov/assistedreproductivetechnology.html,Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is used to treat infertility. It includes fertility treatments that handle both a woman's egg and a man's sperm. It works by removing eggs from a woman's body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman's body. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most common and effective type of ART. ART procedures sometimes use donor eggs; donor sperm; or previously frozen embryos. It may also involve a surrogate or gestational carrier. A surrogate is a woman who becomes pregnant with sperm from the male partner of the couple. A gestational carrier becomes pregnant with an egg from the female partner and the sperm from the male partner. The most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. It can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are put into the woman's body.
Spider Bites,https://medlineplus.gov/spiderbites.html,Though many people are afraid of spiders; they rarely bite people unless threatened.  Most spider bites are harmless.  Occasionally; spider bites can cause allergic reactions. And bites by the venomous black widow and brown recluse spiders can be very dangerous to people. If you are bitten by a spider; you may see a reaction similar to that of a bee sting; including redness; pain and swelling at the site. To treat a spider bite:   Wash the area well with soap and water Apply an ice pack or a wet compress to the area Take over-the-counter pain medicine; if needed Consider using antihistamines for severe swelling Seek medical treatment for small children and adults with severe symptoms
Varicose Veins,https://medlineplus.gov/varicoseveins.html,Varicose veins are swollen; twisted veins that you can see just under the skin. They usually occur in the legs; but also can form in other parts of the body. Hemorrhoids are a type of varicose vein.Your veins have one-way valves that help keep blood flowing toward your heart. If the valves are weak or damaged; blood can back up and pool in your veins. This causes the veins to swell; which can lead to varicose veins.Varicose veins are very common. You are more at risk if you are older; are female; have obesity; don't exercise; or have a family history of varicose veins. They can also be more common in pregnancy.Doctors often diagnose varicose veins from a physical exam. Sometimes you may need additional tests.Exercising; losing weight; elevating your legs when resting; and not crossing them when sitting can help keep varicose veins from getting worse. Wearing loose clothing and avoiding long periods of standing can also help. If varicose veins are painful or you don't like the way they look; your doctor may recommend procedures to remove them.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Spina Bifida,https://medlineplus.gov/spinabifida.html,Spina bifida is a neural tube defect - a type of birth defect of the brain; spine; or spinal cord. It happens if the spinal column of the fetus doesn't close completely during the first month of pregnancy. This can damage the nerves and spinal cord. Screening tests during pregnancy can check for spina bifida. Sometimes it is discovered only after the baby is born.The symptoms of spina bifida vary from person to person. Most people with spina bifida are of normal intelligence. Some people need assistive devices such as braces; crutches; or wheelchairs. They may have learning difficulties; urinary and bowel problems; or hydrocephalus; a buildup of fluid in the brain.The exact cause of spina bifida is unknown. It seems to run in families. Taking folic acid can reduce the risk of having a baby with spina bifida. It's in most multivitamins. Women who could become pregnant should take it daily.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Spinal Cord Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/spinalcorddiseases.html,Your spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that runs down the middle of your back. It carries signals back and forth between your body and your brain. It is protected by your vertebrae; which are the bone disks that make up your spine. If you have an accident that damages the vertebrae or other parts of the spine; this can also injure the spinal cord. Other spinal cord problems includeTumorsInfections such as meningitis and polioInflammatory diseasesAutoimmune diseases Degenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  and spinal muscular atrophySymptoms vary but might include pain; numbness; loss of sensation and muscle weakness. These symptoms can occur around the spinal cord; and also in other areas such as your arms and legs. Treatments often include medicines and surgery.
Spinal Cord Injuries,https://medlineplus.gov/spinalcordinjuries.html,Your spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that runs down the middle of your back. It carries signals back and forth between your body and your brain. A spinal cord injury disrupts the signals. Spinal cord injuries usually begin with a blow that fractures or dislocates your vertebrae; the bone disks that make up your spine. Most injuries don't cut through your spinal cord. Instead; they cause damage when pieces of vertebrae tear into cord tissue or press down on the nerve parts that carry signals.Spinal cord injuries can be complete or incomplete. With a complete spinal cord injury; the cord can't send signals below the level of the injury. As a result; you are paralyzed below the injury. With an incomplete injury; you have some movement and sensation below the injury.A spinal cord injury is a medical emergency. Immediate treatment can reduce long-term effects. Treatments may include medicines; braces or traction to stabilize the spine; and surgery. Later treatment usually includes medicines and rehabilitation therapy. Mobility aids and assistive devices may help you to get around and do some daily tasks.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Spinal Muscular Atrophy,https://medlineplus.gov/spinalmuscularatrophy.html,Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease that attacks nerve cells; called motor neurons; in the spinal cord. These cells communicate with your voluntary muscles - the ones you can control; like in your arms and legs. As the neurons die; the muscles weaken. This can affect walking; crawling; breathing; swallowing; and head and neck control.SMA runs in families. Parents usually have no symptoms; but still carry the gene. Genetic counseling is important if the disease runs in your family.There are many types of SMA. Some of them are fatal. Some people have a normal life expectancy. It depends on the type and how it affects breathing. There is no cure. Treatments help with symptoms and prevent complications.  They may include machines to help with breathing; nutritional support; physical therapy; and medicines.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Spinal Stenosis,https://medlineplus.gov/spinalstenosis.html,Your spine; or backbone; protects your spinal cord and allows you to stand and bend. Spinal stenosis causes narrowing in your spine. The narrowing puts pressure on your nerves and spinal cord and can cause pain.Spinal stenosis occurs mostly in people older than 50. Younger people with a spine injury or a narrow spinal canal are also at risk. Diseases such as arthritis and scoliosis can cause spinal stenosis; too. Symptoms might appear gradually or not at all. They includePain in your neck or backNumbness; weakness; cramping; or pain in your arms or legsPain going down the legFoot problemsDoctors diagnose spinal stenosis with a physical exam and imaging tests. Treatments include medications; physical therapy; braces; and surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Spine Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/spineinjuriesanddisorders.html,Your backbone; or spine; is made up of 26 bone discs called vertebrae. The vertebrae protect your spinal cord and allow you to stand and bend.  A number of problems can change the structure of the spine or damage the vertebrae and surrounding tissue. They include  Infections Injuries Tumors Conditions; such as ankylosing spondylitis and scoliosis Bone changes that come with age; such as spinal stenosis and herniated disks  Spinal diseases often cause pain when bone changes put pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. They can also limit movement. Treatments differ by disease; but sometimes they include back braces and surgery.
Smokeless Tobacco,https://medlineplus.gov/smokelesstobacco.html,Many people who chew tobacco or dip snuff think it's safer than smoking. But you don't have to smoke tobacco for it to be dangerous. Chewing or dipping carries risks like  Cancer of the mouth Decay of exposed tooth roots Pulling away of the gums from the teeth White patches or red sores in the mouth that can turn to cancer  Recent research shows the dangers of smokeless tobacco may go beyond the mouth. It might also play a role in other cancers; heart disease and stroke.  Smokeless tobacco contains more nicotine than cigarettes. Nicotine is a highly addictive drug that makes it hard to stop using tobacco once you start. Having a quit date and a quitting plan can help you stop successfully.

Spleen Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/spleendiseases.html,Your spleen is an organ above your stomach and under your ribs on your left side. It is about as big as your fist. The spleen is part of your lymphatic system; which fights infection and keeps your body fluids in balance. It contains white blood cells that fight germs. Your spleen also helps control the amount of blood in your body; and destroys old and damaged cells.  Certain diseases might cause your spleen to swell. You can also damage or rupture your spleen in an injury; especially if it is already swollen. If your spleen is too damaged; you might need surgery to remove it. You can live without a spleen. Other organs; such as your liver; will take over some of the spleen's work. Without a spleen; however; your body will lose some of its ability to fight infections.

A foreign body is something that is stuck inside you but isn't supposed to be there. You may inhale or swallow a foreign body; or you may get one from an injury to almost any part of your body.  Foreign bodies are more common in small children; who sometimes stick things in their mouths; ears; and noses. Some foreign bodies; like a small splinter; do not cause serious harm. Inhaled or swallowed foreign bodies may cause choking or bowel obstruction and may require medical care.
Ankylosing Spondylitis,https://medlineplus.gov/ankylosingspondylitis.html,Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis of the spine. It causes inflammation between your vertebrae; which are the bones that make up your spine; and in the joints between your spine and pelvis. In some people; it can affect other joints.AS is more common and more severe in men. It often runs in families. The cause is unknown; but it is likely that both genes and factors in the environment play a role.Early symptoms of AS include back pain and stiffness. These problems often start in late adolescence or early adulthood. Over time; AS can fuse your vertebrae together; limiting movement. Some people have symptoms that come and go. Others have severe; ongoing pain.A diagnosis of AS is based on your medical history and a physical examination. You may also have imaging or blood tests.AS has no cure; but medicines can relieve symptoms and may keep the disease from getting worse. Eating a healthy diet; not smoking; and exercising can also help. In rare cases; you may need surgery to straighten the spine.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease

Miscarriage,https://medlineplus.gov/miscarriage.html,A miscarriage is an unexpected loss of pregnancy before the 20th week of pregnancy. Most miscarriages happen very early in the pregnancy; often before a woman even knows she is pregnant.Factors that may contribute to miscarriage includeA genetic problem with the fetusProblems with the uterus or cervixChronic diseases; such as polycystic ovary syndromeSigns of a miscarriage include vaginal spotting; abdominal pain or cramping; and fluid or tissue passing from the vagina. Bleeding can be a symptom of miscarriage; but many women also have it in early pregnancy and don't miscarry. To be sure; contact your health care provider right away if you have bleeding.Women who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not need any treatment. In some cases; there is tissue left in the uterus. Doctors use a procedure called a dilatation and curettage (D&C) or medicines to remove the tissue.Counseling may help you cope with your grief. Later; if you do decide to try again; work closely with your health care provider to lower the risks. Many women who have a miscarriage go on to have healthy babies.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Sports Fitness,https://medlineplus.gov/sportsfitness.html,Sports can be a great way to get in shape or stay that way. Having a specific goal can be a great motivator.  Physically; you need strength and endurance. Your training will vary with your sport. You would not train the same way for pole vaulting as for swimming. You might; however; cross train. Cross training simply means that you include a variety of fitness activities in your program. Research shows that cross training builds stronger bones.  Remember to listen to your body. If you frequently feel exhausted or you are in pain; you may be overdoing it. Injuries can be the result. And be sure that you use your body and your equipment safely.  What you eat and drink is also important. Water is the most important nutrient for active people. Drink it before; during and after workouts.
Sports Injuries,https://medlineplus.gov/sportsinjuries.html,Exercising is good for you; but sometimes you can injure yourself when you play sports or exercise. Accidents; poor training practices; or improper gear can cause them. Some people get hurt because they are not in shape. Not warming up or stretching enough can also lead to injuries. The most common sports injuries areSprains and strains  Knee injuries  Swollen muscles  Achilles tendon injuries  Pain along the shin bone Rotator cuff injuries Fractures  Dislocations If you get hurt; stop playing. Continuing to play or exercise can cause more harm.  Treatment often begins with the RICE (Rest; Ice; Compression; and Elevation) method to relieve pain; reduce swelling; and speed healing. Other possible treatments include pain relievers; keeping the injured area from moving; rehabilitation; and sometimes surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Sports Safety,https://medlineplus.gov/sportssafety.html,Playing sports can be fun; but it can also be dangerous if you are not careful. You can help prevent injuries byGetting a physical to make sure you are healthy before you start playing your sportWearing the right shoes; gear; and equipment Drinking lots of water Warming up and stretchingIf you have already hurt yourself playing a sport; make sure you recover completely before you start up again.  If possible; protect the injured part of your body with padding; a brace; or special equipment. When you do start playing again; start slowly.

Sprains and Strains,https://medlineplus.gov/sprainsandstrains.html,A sprain is a stretched or torn ligament. Ligaments are tissues that connect bones at a joint. Falling; twisting; or getting hit can all cause a sprain. Ankle and wrist sprains are common. Symptoms include pain; swelling; bruising; and being unable to move your joint. You might feel a pop or tear when the injury happens. A strain is a stretched or torn muscle or tendon. Tendons are tissues that connect muscle to bone. Twisting or pulling these tissues can cause a strain. Strains can happen suddenly or develop over time. Back and hamstring muscle strains are common. Many people get strains playing sports. Symptoms include pain; muscle spasms; swelling; and trouble moving the muscle. At first; treatment of both sprains and strains usually involves resting the injured area; icing it; wearing a bandage or device that compresses the area; and medicines. Later treatment might include exercise and physical therapy. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Eye Movement Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eyemovementdisorders.html,When you look at an object; you're using several muscles to move both eyes to focus on it. If you have a problem with the muscles; the eyes don't work properly.There are many kinds of eye movement disorders. Two common ones areStrabismus - a disorder in which the two eyes don't line up in the same direction. This results in "crossed eyes" or "walleye."Nystagmus - fast; uncontrollable movements of the eyes; sometimes called "dancing eyes"Some eye movement disorders are present at birth. Others develop over time and may be associated with other problems; such as injuries. Treatments include glasses; patches; eye muscle exercises; and surgery. There is no cure for some kinds of eye movement disorders; such as most kinds of nystagmus.
Antidepressants,https://medlineplus.gov/antidepressants.html,Antidepressants are medicines that treat depression. Your doctor can prescribe them for you. They work to balance some of the natural chemicals in our brains. It may take several weeks for them to help. There are several types of antidepressants. You and your doctor may have to try a few before finding what works best for you.Antidepressants may cause mild side effects that usually do not last long. These may include headache; nausea; sleep problems; restlessness; and sexual problems. Tell your doctor if you have any side effects. You should also let your doctor know if you take any other medicines; vitamins; or herbal supplements.It is important to keep taking your medicines; even if you feel better.

Staphylococcal Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/staphylococcalinfections.html,Staph is short for Staphylococcus; a type of bacteria. There are over 30 types; but Staphylococcus aureus causes most staph infections (pronounced "staff infections"); including  Skin infections Pneumonia Food poisoning Toxic shock syndrome Blood poisoning (bacteremia)  Skin infections are the most common. They can look like pimples or boils. They may be red; swollen and painful; and sometimes have pus or other drainage. They can turn into impetigo; which turns into a crust on the skin; or cellulitis; a swollen; red area of skin that feels hot. Anyone can get a staph skin infection. You are more likely to get one if you have a cut or scratch; or have contact with a person or surface that has staph bacteria. The best way to prevent staph is to keep hands and wounds clean.  Most staph skin infections are easily treated with antibiotics or by draining the infection. Some staph bacteria such as MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) are resistant to certain antibiotics; making infections harder to treat.
Statins,https://medlineplus.gov/statins.html,Statins are drugs used to lower cholesterol. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much in your blood; it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them.If diet and exercise don't reduce your cholesterol levels; you may need to take medicine. Often; this medicine is a statin.  Statins interfere with the production of cholesterol in your liver. They lower bad cholesterol levels and raise good cholesterol levels.  This can slow the formation of plaques in your arteries.Statins are relatively safe for most people. But they are not recommended for pregnant patients or those with active or chronic liver disease. They can also cause serious muscle problems. Some statins also interact adversely with other drugs.    You may have fewer side effects with one statin drug than another. Researchers are also studying the use of statins for other conditions.Food and Drug Administration
Health Statistics,https://medlineplus.gov/healthstatistics.html,You see them all the time in the news - the number of people who were in the hospital last year; the percentage of kids who are overweight; the rate at which people are catching the flu; the average cost of a medical procedure. These are all types of health statistics.Health statistics are numbers about some aspect of health. Statistics about births; deaths; marriages; and divorces are sometimes called "vital statistics." Researchers use statistics to see patterns of diseases in groups of people. This can help in figuring out who is at risk for certain diseases; finding ways to control diseases and deciding which diseases should be studied.
Healthy Living,https://medlineplus.gov/healthyliving.html,Many factors affect your health. Some you cannot control; such as your genetic makeup or your age. But you can make changes to your lifestyle.

Sexually Transmitted Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/sexuallytransmitteddiseases.html,Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are infections that are passed from one person to another through sexual contact. The causes of STDs are bacteria; parasites; yeast; and viruses. There are more than 20 types of STDs; includingChlamydiaGenital herpesGonorrheaHIV/AIDS HPVSyphilisTrichomoniasisMost STDs affect both men and women; but in many cases the health problems they cause can be more severe for women.  If a pregnant woman has an STD; it can cause serious health problems for the baby.Antibiotics can treat STDs caused by bacteria; yeast; or parasites. There is no cure for STDs caused by a virus; but medicines can often help with the symptoms and keep the disease under control.Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces; but does not completely eliminate; the risk of catching or spreading STDs.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Progressive Supranuclear Palsy,https://medlineplus.gov/progressivesupranuclearpalsy.html,Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare brain disease. It affects brain cells that control the movement of your eyes. This leads to serious and permanent problems with balance and the way you walk. It usually occurs in middle-aged or elderly people. Symptoms are very different in each person; but may include personality changes; speech; vision and swallowing problems. Doctors sometimes confuse PSP with Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.  PSP has no cure and no effective treatments. Walking aids; special glasses and certain medicines might help somewhat. Although the disease gets worse over time; it isn't fatal on its own. However; PSP is dangerous because it increases your risk of pneumonia and choking from swallowing problems and injuries from falling. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/polycysticovarysyndrome.html,Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) happens when a woman's ovaries or adrenal glands produce more male hormones than normal.  PCOS causes cysts (fluid-filled sacs) to grow on the ovaries.  Symptoms includeIrregular menstrual periodsInfertilityPelvic painExcess hair growth on the face; chest; stomach; or thighsWeight gainAcne or oily skinPatches of thickened skinWomen with PCOS are at higher risk of diabetes; metabolic syndrome; heart disease; and high blood pressure.PCOS is more common in women who have obesity; or have a mother or sister with PCOS.  To diagnose PCOS; your health care provider may do a physical exam; pelvic exam; blood tests; and an ultrasound.There is no cure; but diet; exercise; and medicines can help control the symptoms. Birth control pills help women have normal periods; reduce male hormone levels; and clear acne. Treatments for infertility caused by PCOS may include medicines; surgery; and in vitro fertilization (IVF).NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Stem Cells,https://medlineplus.gov/stemcells.html,Stem cells are cells with the potential to develop into many different types of cells in the body. They serve as a repair system for the body. There are two main types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells.  Stem cells are different from other cells in the body in three ways:They can divide and renew themselves over a long timeThey are unspecialized; so they cannot do specific functions in the bodyThey have the potential to become specialized cells; such as muscle cells; blood cells; and brain cellsDoctors and scientists are excited about stem cells because they could help in many different areas of health and medical research.  Studying stem cells may help explain how serious conditions such as birth defects and cancer come about. Stem cells may one day be used to make cells and tissues for therapy of many diseases. Examples include Parkinson's disease; Alzheimer's disease; spinal cord injury; heart disease; diabetes; and arthritis.NIH: National Institutes of Health

Family Issues,https://medlineplus.gov/familyissues.html,There are many kinds of families. Some have two parents; while others have a single parent. Sometimes there is no parent and grandparents raise grandchildren. Some children live in foster families; adoptive families; or in stepfamilies.Families are much more than groups of people who share the same genes or the same address. They should be a source of love and support. This does not mean that everyone gets along all the time. Conflicts are a part of family life. Many things can lead to conflict; such as illness; disability; addiction; job loss; school problems; and marital  issues.  Listening to each other and working to resolve conflicts are important in strengthening the family.
Infertility,https://medlineplus.gov/infertility.html,Infertility means not being able to become pregnant after a year of trying. If a woman can get pregnant but keeps having miscarriages or stillbirths; that's also called infertility.Infertility is fairly common. After one year of having unprotected sex; about 15 percent of couples are unable to get pregnant. About a third of the time; infertility can be traced to the woman. In another third of cases; it is because of the man. The rest of the time; it is because of both partners or no cause can be found.There are treatments that are specifically for men or for women. Some involve both partners. Drugs; assisted reproductive technology; and surgery are common treatments. Happily; many couples treated for infertility go on to have babies.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Tubal Ligation,https://medlineplus.gov/tuballigation.html,Tubal ligation (getting your "tubes tied") is a type of surgery. It prevents a woman from getting pregnant. It is a permanent form of birth control; and is effective right away.The surgery cuts; ties; or seals the fallopian tubes. This blocks the path between the ovaries and the uterus. The sperm cannot reach the egg to fertilize it; and the egg cannot reach the uterus. You get the surgery in a hospital or outpatient surgical center. It usually takes about 30 minutes. Almost all women go home the same day. They can return to most normal activities within a few days.Tubal ligation can sometimes be reversed. The reversal is major surgery; and does not always work.
Vasectomy,https://medlineplus.gov/vasectomy.html,Vasectomy is a type of surgery that prevents a man from being able to get a woman pregnant. It is a permanent form of birth control.A vasectomy works by cutting the tubes that carry the sperm out of the testicles. The surgery usually takes no more than 30 minutes.  Most men go home the same day. In most cases; recovery takes less than a week. Having a vasectomy does not affect your sex life.It takes about three months before it is effective. Your doctor will test your semen to make sure that there are no sperm in it.Vasectomies can sometimes be reversed; but not always. Having a vasectomy does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases; such as HIV/AIDS.  Men who have had a vasectomy should still practice safe sex to avoid STDs.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Steroids,https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html,You may have heard of anabolic steroids; which can have harmful effects. But there's another type of steroid - sometimes called a corticosteroid - that treats a variety of problems. These steroids are similar to hormones that your adrenal glands make to fight stress associated with illnesses and injuries. They reduce inflammation and affect the immune system. You may need to take corticosteroids to treatArthritisAsthmaAutoimmune diseases such as lupus and multiple sclerosisSkin conditions such as eczema and rashesSome kinds of cancerSteroids are strong medicines; and they can have side effects; including weakened bones and cataracts. Because of this; you usually take them for as short a time as possible.
Anabolic Steroids,https://medlineplus.gov/anabolicsteroids.html,Anabolic steroids are man-made substances related to male sex hormones. Doctors use anabolic steroids to treat some hormone problems in men; delayed puberty; and muscle loss from some diseases.Bodybuilders and athletes often use anabolic steroids to build muscles and improve athletic performance. Using them this way is not legal or safe. Abuse of anabolic steroids has been linked with many health problems. They  include Acne Breast growth and shrinking of testicles in men Voice deepening and growth of facial hair in women High blood pressureHeart problems; including heart attackLiver disease; including cancerKidney damageAggressive behavior NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Juvenile Arthritis,https://medlineplus.gov/juvenilearthritis.html,Juvenile arthritis (JA) is arthritis that happens in children. It causes joint swelling; pain; stiffness; and loss of motion. It can affect any joint; but is more common in the knees; hands; and feet. In some cases it can affect internal organs as well.The most common type of JA that children get is juvenile idiopathic arthritis. There are several other forms of arthritis affecting children.One early sign of JA may be limping in the morning. Symptoms can come and go. Some children have just one or two flare-ups. Others have symptoms that never go away. JA can cause growth problems and eye inflammation in some children.No one knows exactly what causes JA. Most types are autoimmune disorders. This means that your immune system; which normally helps your body fight infection; attacks your body's own tissues.JA can be hard to diagnose. Your health care provider may do a physical exam; lab tests; and x-rays. A team of providers usually treats JA. Medicines and physical therapy can help maintain movement and reduce swelling and pain. They may also help prevent and treat complications.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Stillbirth,https://medlineplus.gov/stillbirth.html,If a woman loses a pregnancy after she's past her 20th week; it's called a stillbirth. Stillbirths are due to natural causes. They can happen before delivery or during delivery. Causes include:Problems with the placenta; the organ that transports oxygen and nutrients to the fetusGenetic problems with the fetusFetal infectionsOther physical problems in the fetusIn at least half of all cases; it is not possible to tell why the baby died.If stillbirth happens before delivery; your health care provider may induce labor or perform a Cesarean section to deliver the fetus.  In some cases; you can wait until you go into labor yourself.  This usually happens within two weeks of stillbirth.Counseling may help you cope with your grief. Later; if you do decide to try again; work closely with your health care provider to lower the risks. Many women who have a stillbirth go on to have healthy babies.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Ostomy,https://medlineplus.gov/ostomy.html,An ostomy is surgery to create an opening (stoma) from an area inside the body to the outside. It treats certain diseases of the digestive or urinary systems. It can be permanent; when an organ must be removed.  It can be temporary; when the organ needs time to heal.  The organ could be the small intestine; colon; rectum; or bladder. With an ostomy; there must be a new way for wastes to leave the body. There are many different types of ostomy. Some examples areIleostomy - the bottom of the small intestine (ileum) is attached to the stoma. This bypasses the colon; rectum and anus.Colostomy - the colon is attached to the stoma. This bypasses the rectum and the anus. Urostomy - the tubes that carry urine to the bladder are attached to the stoma. This bypasses the bladder.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Abdominal Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/abdominalpain.html,Your abdomen extends from below your chest to your groin. Some people call it the stomach; but your abdomen contains many other important organs. Pain in the abdomen can come from any one of them. The pain may start somewhere else; such as your chest. Severe pain doesn't always mean a serious problem. Nor does mild pain mean a problem is not serious. Call your health care provider if mild pain lasts a week or more or if you have pain with other symptoms. Get medical help immediately ifYou have abdominal pain that is sudden and sharpYou also have pain in your chest; neck or shoulder You're vomiting blood or have blood in your stool Your abdomen is stiff; hard and tender to touch You can't move your bowels; especially if you're also vomiting
Stomach Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/stomachdisorders.html,Your stomach is an organ between your esophagus and small intestine. It is where digestion of protein begins. The stomach has three tasks. It stores swallowed food. It mixes the food with stomach acids. Then it sends the mixture on to the small intestine.Most people have a problem with their stomach at one time or another. Indigestion and heartburn are common problems. You can relieve some stomach problems with over-the-counter medicines and lifestyle changes; such as avoiding fatty foods or eating more slowly. Other problems like peptic ulcers or GERD require medical attention. You should see a doctor if you have any of the following:Blood when you have a bowel movementSevere abdominal painHeartburn not relieved by antacids Unintended weight loss Ongoing vomiting or diarrheaNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Stomach Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/stomachcancer.html,The stomach is an organ between the esophagus and the small intestine. It mixes food with stomach acid and helps digest protein. Stomach cancer mostly affects older people - two-thirds of people who have it are over age 65. Your risk of getting it is also higher if youHave had a Helicobacter pylori infectionHave had stomach inflammationAre a manEat lots of  salted; smoked; or pickled foods Smoke cigarettes Have a family history of stomach cancerIt is hard to diagnose stomach cancer in its early stages. Indigestion and stomach discomfort can be symptoms of early cancer; but other problems can cause the same symptoms. In advanced cases; there may be blood in your stool; vomiting; unexplained weight loss; jaundice; or trouble swallowing. Doctors diagnose stomach cancer with a physical exam; blood and imaging tests; an endoscopy; and a biopsy.Because it is often found late; it can be hard to treat stomach cancer.  Treatment options include surgery; chemotherapy; radiation or a combination.NIH: National Cancer Institute

Gastroenteritis,https://medlineplus.gov/gastroenteritis.html, Have you ever had the "stomach flu?" What you probably had was gastroenteritis - not a type of flu at all.  Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the lining of the intestines caused by a virus; bacteria or parasites.  Viral gastroenteritis is the second most common illness in the U.S. The cause is often a norovirus infection. It spreads through contaminated food or water; and contact with an infected person.  The best prevention is frequent hand washing.  Symptoms of gastroenteritis include diarrhea; abdominal pain; vomiting; headache; fever and chills.  Most people recover with no treatment.The most common problem with gastroenteritis is dehydration. This happens if you do not drink enough fluids to replace what you lose through vomiting and diarrhea. Dehydration is most common in babies; young children; the elderly and people with weak immune systems.  NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Weight Loss Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/weightlosssurgery.html,Weight loss surgery helps people with extreme obesity to lose weight. It may be an option if you cannot lose weight through diet and exercise or have serious health problems caused by obesity.There are different types of weight loss surgery.  They often limit the amount of food you can take in. Some types of surgery also affect how you digest food and absorb nutrients. All types have risks and complications; such as infections; hernias; and blood clots.Many people who have the surgery lose weight quickly; but regain some weight later on.  If you follow diet and exercise recommendations; you can keep most of the weight off. You will also need medical follow-up for the rest of your life.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Peptic Ulcer,https://medlineplus.gov/pepticulcer.html,A peptic ulcer is a sore in the lining of your stomach or your duodenum; the first part of your small intestine. A burning stomach pain is the most common symptom. The painStarts between meals or during the nightBriefly stops if you eat or take antacidsLasts for minutes to hoursComes and goes for several days or weeksPeptic ulcers happen when the acids that help you digest food damage the walls of the stomach or duodenum. The most common cause is infection with a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. Another cause is the long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Stress and spicy foods do not cause ulcers; but can make them worse. To see if you have an H. pylori infection; your doctor will test your blood; breath; or stool. Your doctor also may look inside your stomach and duodenum by doing an endoscopy or x-ray.Peptic ulcers will get worse if not treated. Treatment may include medicines to reduce stomach acids or antibiotics to kill H. pylori. Antacids and milk can't heal peptic ulcers. Not smoking and avoiding alcohol can help. You may need surgery if your ulcers don't heal.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Bowel Movement,https://medlineplus.gov/bowelmovement.html,A bowel movement is the last stop in the movement of food through your digestive tract. Your stool passes out of your body through the rectum and anus.  Another name for stool is feces.  It is made of what is left after your digestive system (stomach; small intestine; and colon) absorbs nutrients and fluids from what you eat and drink.Sometimes a bowel movement isn't normal.  Diarrhea happens when stool passes through the large intestine too quickly. Constipation occurs when stool passes through the large intestine too slowly. Bowel incontinence is a problem controlling your bowel movements. Other abnormalities with bowel movements may be a sign of a digestive problem.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Eye Movement Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eyemovementdisorders.html,When you look at an object; you're using several muscles to move both eyes to focus on it. If you have a problem with the muscles; the eyes don't work properly.There are many kinds of eye movement disorders. Two common ones areStrabismus - a disorder in which the two eyes don't line up in the same direction. This results in "crossed eyes" or "walleye."Nystagmus - fast; uncontrollable movements of the eyes; sometimes called "dancing eyes"Some eye movement disorders are present at birth. Others develop over time and may be associated with other problems; such as injuries. Treatments include glasses; patches; eye muscle exercises; and surgery. There is no cure for some kinds of eye movement disorders; such as most kinds of nystagmus.
Streptococcal Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/streptococcalinfections.html,Strep is short for Streptococcus; a type of bacteria.   There are two types: group A and group B.Group A strep causesStrep throat - a sore; red throat. Your tonsils may be swollen and have white spots on them.Scarlet fever - an illness that follows strep throat. It causes a red rash on the body.Impetigo - a skin infectionToxic shock syndromeCellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease)Group B strep can cause blood infections; pneumonia and meningitis in newborns. A screening test during pregnancy can tell if you have it. If you do; I.V. antibiotics during labor can save your baby's life.  Adults can also get group B strep infections; especially if they are elderly or already have health problems. Strep B can cause urinary tract infections; blood infections; skin infections and pneumonia in adults.Antibiotics are used to treat strep infections.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

Pneumococcal Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/pneumococcalinfections.html,Pneumococci are a type of streptococcus bacteria. The bacteria spread through contact with people who are ill or by healthy people who carry the bacteria in the back of their nose. Pneumococcal infections can be mild or severe. The most common types of infections areEar infectionsSinus infectionsPneumoniaSepsisMeningitisHow the diagnosis is made depends upon where the infection is. Your doctor will do a physical exam and health history.  Possible tests may include blood; imaging; or lab tests. Treatment is with antibiotics. Vaccines can prevent pneumococcal infections. There are two vaccines. One is for infants and young children.  The other is for people at high risk; including those who are over 65 years old; have chronic illnesses or weak immune systems; smoke; have asthma; or live in long-term care facilities.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Stress,https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html,Everyone feels stressed from time to time. Not all stress is bad. All animals have a stress response; and it can be life-saving. But chronic stress can cause both physical and mental harm.There are at least three different types of stress:Routine stress related to the pressures of work; family; and other daily responsibilitiesStress brought about by a sudden negative change; such as losing a job; divorce; or illnessTraumatic stress; which happens when you are in danger of being seriously hurt or killed. Examples include a major accident; war; assault; or a natural disaster. This type of stress can cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Different people may feel stress in different ways. Some people experience digestive symptoms. Others may have headaches; sleeplessness; depressed mood; anger; and irritability. People under chronic stress get more frequent and severe viral infections; such as the flu or common cold. Vaccines; such as the flu shot; are less effective for them.Some people cope with stress more effectively than others. It's important to know your limits when it comes to stress; so you can avoid more serious health effects.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
Urinary Incontinence,https://medlineplus.gov/urinaryincontinence.html,Urinary incontinence (UI) is loss of bladder control. Symptoms can range from mild leaking to uncontrollable wetting. It can happen to anyone; but it becomes more common with age. Women experience UI twice as often as men.Most bladder control problems happen when muscles are too weak or too active. If the muscles that keep your bladder closed are weak; you may have accidents when you sneeze; laugh or lift a heavy object. This is stress incontinence. If bladder muscles become too active; you may feel a strong urge to go to the bathroom when you have little urine in your bladder. This is urge incontinence or overactive bladder.  There are other causes of incontinence; such as prostate problems and nerve damage.Treatment depends on the type of problem you have and what best fits your lifestyle. It may include simple exercises; medicines; special devices or procedures prescribed by your doctor; or surgery. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Stroke,https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html,A stroke is a medical emergency. Strokes happen when blood flow to your brain stops. Within minutes; brain cells begin to die.   There are two kinds of stroke. The more common kind; called ischemic stroke; is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. The other kind; called hemorrhagic stroke; is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain.   "Mini-strokes" or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs); occur when the blood supply to the brain is briefly interrupted.Symptoms of stroke are Sudden numbness or weakness of the face; arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)Sudden confusion; trouble speaking or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden trouble walking; dizziness; loss of balance or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeIf you have any of these symptoms; you must get to a hospital quickly to begin treatment. Acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot or by stopping the bleeding.  Post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage.  Drug therapy with blood thinners is the most common treatment for stroke.  NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Stroke Rehabilitation,https://medlineplus.gov/strokerehabilitation.html,A stroke can cause lasting brain damage. People who survive a stroke need to relearn skills they lost because of the damage. Rehabilitation can help them relearn those skills.The effects of a stroke depend on which area of the brain was damaged. The types of disabilities a stroke can cause includeParalysis or problems controlling movementPain and other problems with the sensesProblems using or understanding languageProblems with thinking and memoryEmotional disturbancesStroke rehabilitation involves many kinds of health professionals. The goal is to help stroke survivors become as independent as possible and to have the best possible quality of life.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Stuttering,https://medlineplus.gov/stuttering.html,Stuttering is a problem that affects the flow of your speech. If you stutter; you may Make certain words sound longer than they should beFind it hard to start a new word Repeat words or parts of words Get tense when you try to speak. You may blink your eyes rapidly; or your lips and jaw may tremble as you struggle to get the words out.Stuttering can affect anyone. It is most common in young children who are still learning to speak. Boys are three times more likely to stutter than girls. Most children stop stuttering as they grow older. Less than 1 percent of adults stutter.Scientists don't fully understand why some people stutter. The problem seems to run in families. There is no cure; but treatments can help. They include stuttering therapy; electronic devices; and self-help groups. Starting stuttering therapy early for young children can keep it from becoming a lifelong problem. NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Eyelid Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eyeliddisorders.html,Your eyelids help protect your eyes. When you blink; your eyelids spread moisture over your eyes. Blinking also helps move dirt or other particles off the surface of the eye.  You close your eyelids when you see something coming toward your eyes.  This can help protect against injuries.Like most other parts of your body; your eyelids can get infected; inflamed; or even develop cancer. There are also specific eyelid problems; includingEyelids that turn in or outEyelids that droopAbnormal blinking or twitchingTreatment of eyelid problems depends on the cause.
Hemorrhagic Stroke,https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhagicstroke.html,A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic stroke is the less common type. It happens when a blood vessel breaks and bleeds into the brain. Within minutes; brain cells begin to die. Causes include a bleeding aneurysm; an arteriovenous malformation (AVM); or an artery wall that breaks open.Symptoms of stroke areSudden numbness or weakness of the face; arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)Sudden confusion; trouble speaking or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden trouble walking; dizziness; loss of balance or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeIt is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. With a hemorrhagic stroke; the first steps are to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and then control it.  Surgery may be needed.  Post-stroke rehabilitation can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse,https://medlineplus.gov/alcoholismandalcoholabuse.html,For most adults; moderate alcohol use is probably not harmful. However; about 18 million adult Americans have an alcohol use disorder (AUD).  This means that their drinking causes distress and harm.  It includes alcoholism and alcohol abuse.Alcoholism; or alcohol dependence; is a disease that causesCraving - a strong need to drinkLoss of control - not being able to stop drinking once you've startedPhysical dependence - withdrawal symptomsTolerance - the need to drink more alcohol to feel the same effectWith alcohol abuse; you are not physically dependent; but you still have a serious problem. The drinking may cause problems at home; work; or school. It may cause you to put yourself in dangerous situations; or lead to legal or social problems.Another common problem is binge drinking. It is drinking about five or more drinks in two hours for men.  For women; it is about four or more drinks in two hours.Too much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It can cause damage to the liver; brain; and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can harm your baby. Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes; injuries; homicide; and suicide.You may have an AUD if you can answer yes to two or more of these questions:In the past year; have youEnded up drinking more or for a longer time than you had planned to?Wanted to cut down or stop drinking; or tried to; but couldn't?Spent a lot of your time drinking; or recovering from drinking?Felt a strong need to drink?Found that drinking - or being sick from drinking - often interfered with your family life; job; or school?Kept drinking even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends?Given up or cut back on activities that you enjoyed just so you could drink?Gotten into dangerous situations while drinking or after drinking? Some examples are driving drunk and having unsafe sex.Kept drinking even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious? Or when it was adding to another health problem?Had to drink more and more to feel the effects of the alcohol?Had withdrawal symptoms when the alcohol was wearing off? They include trouble sleeping; shakiness; irritability; anxiety; depression; restlessness; nausea; and sweating. In severe cases; you could have a fever; seizures; or hallucinations.If you have any of these symptoms; your drinking may already be a cause for concern. The more symptoms you have; the more serious the problem is. If you think you might have an AUD; see your health care provider for an evaluation. Your provider can help make a treatment plan; prescribe medicines; and if needed; give you treatment referrals.NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
Drug Abuse,https://medlineplus.gov/drugabuse.html,Drug abuse is a serious public health problem that affects almost every community and family in some way. Each year drug abuse causes millions of serious illnesses or injuries among Americans.  Abused drugs includeMethamphetamineAnabolic steroidsClub drugsCocaineHeroinInhalantsMarijuanaPrescription drugs; including opioidsDrug abuse also plays a role in many major social problems; such as drugged driving; violence; stress; and child abuse. Drug abuse can lead to homelessness; crime; and missed work or problems with keeping a job. It harms unborn babies and destroys families. There are different types of treatment for drug abuse. But the best is to prevent drug abuse in the first place. NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Drugs and Young People,https://medlineplus.gov/drugsandyoungpeople.html,Drug abuse is a serious public health problem. It affects almost every community and family in some way.  Drug abuse in children and teenagers may pose a greater hazard than in older people. This is because their brains are not yet fully developed.  As a result; the brains of young people may be more susceptible to drug abuse and addiction than adult brains.Abused drugs includeAmphetamines Anabolic steroids Club drugsCocaine Heroin InhalantsMarijuanaPrescription drugsThere are different types of treatment for drug abuse. But it is better to prevent drug abuse in the first place.NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Pregnancy and Substance Abuse,https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancyandsubstanceabuse.html,When you are pregnant; you are not just "eating for two." You also breathe and drink for two; so it is important to carefully consider what you give to your baby.  If you smoke; use alcohol or take illegal drugs; so does your unborn baby.First; don't smoke. Smoking during pregnancy passes nicotine and cancer-causing drugs to your baby. Smoke also keeps your baby from getting nourishment and raises the risk of stillbirth or premature birth. Don't drink alcohol. There is no known safe amount of alcohol a woman can drink while pregnant.  Alcohol can cause life-long physical and behavioral problems in children; including fetal alcohol syndrome.  Don't use illegal drugs. Using illegal drugs may cause underweight babies; birth defects or withdrawal symptoms after birth.If you are pregnant and you smoke; drink alcohol or do drugs; get help.  Your health care provider can recommend programs to help you quit. You and your baby will be better off.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Cardiac Arrest,https://medlineplus.gov/cardiacarrest.html,The heart has an internal electrical system that controls the rhythm of the heartbeat. Problems can cause abnormal heart rhythms; called arrhythmias. There are many types of arrhythmia. During an arrhythmia; the heart can beat too fast; too slow; or it can stop beating. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurs when the heart develops an arrhythmia that causes it to stop beating. This is different than a heart attack; where the heart usually continues to beat but blood flow to the heart is blocked. There are many possible causes of SCA. They include coronary heart disease; physical stress; and some inherited disorders. Sometimes there is no known cause for the SCA.Without medical attention; the person will die within a few minutes. People are less likely to die if they have early defibrillation. Defibrillation sends an electric shock to restore the heart rhythm to normal. You should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to a person having SCA until defibrillation can be done.If you have had an SCA; an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) reduces the chance of dying from a second SCA.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/suddeninfantdeathsyndrome.html,Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden; unexplained death of an infant younger than one year old. Some people call SIDS "crib death" because many babies who die of SIDS are found in their cribs. SIDS is the leading cause of death in children between one month and one year old.  Most SIDS deaths occur when babies are between one month and four months old. Premature babies; boys; African Americans; and American Indian/Alaska Native infants have a higher risk of SIDS.Although health care professionals don't know what causes SIDS; they do know ways to reduce the risk. These includePlacing your baby on his or her back to sleep; even for short naps. "Tummy time" is for when babies are awake and someone is watchingHaving your baby sleep in your room for at least the first six months. Your baby should sleep close to you; but on a separate surface designed for infants; such as a crib or bassinet.Using a firm sleep surface; such as a crib mattress covered with a fitted sheet Keeping soft objects and loose bedding away from your baby's sleep areaBreastfeeding your babyMaking sure that your baby doesn't get too hot. Keep the room at a comfortable temperature for an adult.Not smoking during pregnancy or allowing anyone to smoke near your babyNIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Carbohydrates,https://medlineplus.gov/carbohydrates.html,Carbohydrates are one of the main types of nutrients.  They are the most important source of energy for your body. Your digestive system changes carbohydrates into glucose (blood sugar). Your body  uses this sugar for energy for your cells; tissues and organs. It stores any extra sugar in your liver and muscles for when it is needed.Carbohydrates are called simple or complex; depending on their chemical structure. Simple carbohydrates include sugars found naturally in foods such as fruits; vegetables; milk; and milk products. They also include sugars added during food processing and refining. Complex carbohydrates include whole grain breads and cereals; starchy vegetables and legumes. Many of the complex carbohydrates are good sources of fiber.For a healthy diet; limit the amount of added sugar that you eat and choose whole grains over refined grains.
Diabetes,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetes.html,Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose; or blood sugar; levels are too high.  Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy.  With type 1 diabetes; your body does not make insulin.  With type 2 diabetes; the more common type; your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin; the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes.  This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes.  Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes.Over time; having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems.    It can damage your eyes; kidneys; and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease; stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes; called gestational diabetes.Blood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test; the A1C; can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Exercise; weight control and sticking to your meal plan can help control your diabetes. You should also monitor your blood glucose level and take medicine if prescribed. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Diabetes Type 2,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype2.html,Diabetes means your blood glucose; or blood sugar; levels are too high.  With type 2 diabetes; the more common type; your body does not make or use insulin well. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin; too much glucose stays in your blood.  Over time; high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart; eyes; kidneys; nerves; and gums and teeth.You have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if you are older; have obesity; have a family history of diabetes; or do not exercise. Having prediabetes also increases your risk.  Prediabetes means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. If you are at risk for type 2 diabetes; you may be able to delay or prevent developing it by making some lifestyle changes.The symptoms of type 2 diabetes appear slowly.  Some people do not notice symptoms at all.  The symptoms can includeBeing very thirstyUrinating oftenFeeling very hungry or tiredLosing weight without tryingHaving sores that heal slowlyHaving blurry eyesightBlood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test; the A1C; can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Many people can manage their diabetes through healthy eating; physical activity; and blood glucose testing.  Some people also need to take diabetes medicines.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Suicide,https://medlineplus.gov/suicide.html,Suicide is the tenth most common cause of death in the United States. People may consider suicide when they are hopeless and can't see any other solution to their problems. Often it's related to serious depression; alcohol or substance abuse; or a major stressful event.People who have the highest risk of suicide are white men. But women and teens report more suicide attempts. If someone talks about suicide; you should take it seriously. Urge them to get help from their doctor or the emergency room; or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). It is available 24/7.Therapy and medicines can help most people who have suicidal thoughts. Treating mental illnesses and substance abuse can reduce the risk of suicide.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health
Sun Exposure,https://medlineplus.gov/sunexposure.html,Ultraviolet (UV) rays are an invisible form of radiation. They can pass through your skin and damage your skin cells. Sunburns are a sign of skin damage. Suntans aren't healthy; either. They appear after the sun's rays have already killed some cells and damaged others. UV rays can cause skin damage during any season or at any temperature.  They can also cause eye problems; wrinkles; skin spots; and skin cancer.To protect yourself Stay out of the sun when it is strongest (between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.)Use sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher Wear protective clothing Wear wraparound sunglasses that provide 100 percent UV ray protectionAvoid sunlamps and tanning beds Check your skin regularly for changes in the size; shape; color; or feel of birthmarks; moles; and spots.

Heat Illness,https://medlineplus.gov/heatillness.html,Your body normally cools itself by sweating.  During hot weather; especially with high humidity; sweating just isn't enough.  Your body temperature can rise to dangerous levels and you can develop a heat illness.  Most heat illnesses occur from staying out in the heat too long. Exercising too much for your age and physical condition are also factors. Older adults; young children and those who are sick or overweight are most at risk. Drinking fluids to prevent dehydration; replenishing salt and minerals; and limiting time in the heat can help. Heat-related illnesses include  Heatstroke - a life-threatening illness in which body temperature may rise above 106 F in minutes; symptoms include dry skin; rapid; strong pulse and dizziness  Heat exhaustion -  an illness that can precede heatstroke; symptoms include heavy sweating; rapid breathing and a fast; weak pulse  Heat cramps - muscle pains or spasms that happen during heavy exercise   Heat rash - skin irritation from excessive sweating   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/surgery.html,There are many reasons to have surgery. Some operations can relieve or prevent pain. Others can reduce a symptom of a problem or improve some body function. Some surgeries are done to find a problem. For example; a surgeon may do a biopsy; which involves removing a piece of tissue to examine under a microscope. Some surgeries; like heart surgery; can save your life.Some operations that once needed large incisions (cuts in the body) can now be done using much smaller cuts. This is called laparoscopic surgery. Surgeons insert a thin tube with a camera to see; and use small tools to do the surgery.After surgery there can be a risk of complications; including infection; too much bleeding; reaction to anesthesia; or accidental injury. There is almost always some pain with surgery.Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/plasticandcosmeticsurgery.html,Surgeons can reshape the appearance of body parts through cosmetic surgery.  Some of the most common body parts people want to improve through surgery include   Breasts: Increase or reduce the size of breasts or reshape sagging breasts   Ears: Reduce the size of large ears or set protruding ears back closer to the head  Eyes: Correct drooping upper eyelids or remove puffy bags below the eyes  Face: Remove facial wrinkles; creases or acne scars  Hair: Fill in balding areas with one's own hair  Nose: Change the shape of the nose   Tummy:  Flatten the abdomen
Assisted Reproductive Technology,https://medlineplus.gov/assistedreproductivetechnology.html,Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is used to treat infertility. It includes fertility treatments that handle both a woman's egg and a man's sperm. It works by removing eggs from a woman's body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman's body. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most common and effective type of ART. ART procedures sometimes use donor eggs; donor sperm; or previously frozen embryos. It may also involve a surrogate or gestational carrier. A surrogate is a woman who becomes pregnant with sperm from the male partner of the couple. A gestational carrier becomes pregnant with an egg from the female partner and the sperm from the male partner. The most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. It can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are put into the woman's body.
Swallowing Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/swallowingdisorders.html,If you have a swallowing disorder; you may have difficulty or pain when swallowing. Some people cannot swallow at all. Others may have trouble swallowing liquids; foods; or saliva. This makes it hard to eat. Often; it can be difficult to take in enough calories and fluids to nourish your body.Anyone can have a swallowing disorder; but it is more likely in the elderly. It often happens because of other conditions; includingNervous system disorders; such as Parkinson's disease and cerebral palsyProblems with your esophagus; including GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)StrokeHead or spinal cord injuryCancer of the head; neck; or esophagusMedicines can help some people; while others may need surgery.  Swallowing treatment with a speech-language pathologist can help.  You may find it helpful to change your diet or hold your head or neck in a certain way when you eat. In very serious cases; people may need feeding tubes.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Sweat,https://medlineplus.gov/sweat.html,Sweat is a clear; salty liquid produced by glands in your skin. Sweating is how your body cools itself. You sweat mainly under your arms and on your feet and palms. When sweat mixes with bacteria on your skin; it can cause a smell. Bathing regularly and using antiperspirants or deodorants can help control the odor. Sweating a lot is normal when it is hot or when you exercise; are anxious; or have a fever. It also happens during menopause. If you often sweat too much; it's called hyperhidrosis. Causes include thyroid or nervous system disorders; low blood sugar; or another health problem. Sweating too little; anhidrosis; can be life-threatening because your body can overheat. Causes of anhidrosis include dehydration; burns; and some skin and nerve disorders.

Edema,https://medlineplus.gov/edema.html,Edema means swelling caused by fluid in your body's tissues. It usually occurs in the feet; ankles and legs; but it can involve your entire body.Causes of edema includeEating too much saltSunburnHeart failureKidney diseaseLiver problems from cirrhosisPregnancyProblems with  lymph nodes; especially after mastectomySome medicinesStanding or walking a lot when the weather is warmTo keep swelling down; your health care provider may recommend keeping your legs raised when sitting; wearing support stockings; limiting how much salt you eat; or taking a medicine called a diuretic - also called a water pill.
Ear Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/earinfections.html,Ear infections are the most common reason parents bring their child to a doctor. Three out of four children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday.  Adults can also get ear infections; but they are less common.The infection usually affects the middle ear and is called otitis media. The tubes inside the ears become clogged with fluid and mucus. This can affect hearing; because sound cannot get through all that fluid.If your child isn't old enough to say "My ear hurts;" here are a few things to look forTugging at earsCrying more than usualFluid draining from the earTrouble sleepingBalance difficultiesHearing problemsYour health care provider will diagnose an ear infection by looking inside the ear with an instrument called an otoscope.Often; ear infections go away on their own. Your health care provider may recommend pain relievers. Severe infections and infections in young babies may require antibiotics. Children who get infections often may need surgery to place small tubes inside their ears. The tubes relieve pressure in the ears so that the child can hear again.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
H1N1 Flu (Swine Flu),https://medlineplus.gov/h1n1fluswineflu.html,Swine flu is an infection caused by a virus. It's named for a virus that pigs can get. People do not normally get swine flu; but human infections can and do happen.  In 2009 a strain of swine flu called H1N1 infected many people around the world.The virus is contagious and can spread from human to human.   Symptoms of swine flu in people are similar to the symptoms of regular human flu and include fever; cough; sore throat; body aches; headache; chills and fatigue.There are antiviral medicines you can take to prevent or treat swine flu. There is a vaccine available to protect against swine flu. You can help prevent the spread of germs that cause respiratory illnesses like influenza byCovering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.Washing your hands often with soap and water; especially after you cough or sneeze. You can also use alcohol-based hand cleaners.Avoiding touching your eyes; nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.Trying to avoid close contact with sick people.Staying home from work or school if you are sick.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Lymphatic Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/lymphaticdiseases.html,The lymphatic system is a network of tissues and organs. It is made up ofLymph - a fluid that contains white blood cells that defend against germsLymph vessels - vessels that carry lymph throughout your body.  They are different from blood vessels.Lymph nodes - glands found throughout the lymph vessels. Along with your spleen; these nodes are where white blood cells fight infection.Your bone marrow and thymus produce the cells in lymph. They are part of the system; too.The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps your body fluids in balance. If it's not working properly; fluid builds in your tissues and causes swelling; called lymphedema. Other lymphatic system problems can include infections; blockage; and cancer.
Fainting,https://medlineplus.gov/fainting.html,Fainting is a temporary loss of consciousness. If you're about to faint; you'll feel dizzy; lightheaded; or nauseous. Your field of vision may "white out" or "black out."  Your skin may be cold and clammy.  You lose muscle control at the same time; and may fall down.Fainting usually happens when your blood pressure drops suddenly; causing a decrease in blood flow to your brain. It is more common in older people. Some causes of fainting includeHeat or dehydration Emotional distress Standing up too quickly Certain medicines Drop in blood sugar Heart problems When someone faints; make sure that the airway is clear and check for breathing. The person should stay lying down for 10-15 minutes.  Most people recover completely. Fainting is usually nothing to worry about; but it can sometimes be a sign of a serious problem. If you faint; it's important to see your health care provider and find out why it happened.
Angina,https://medlineplus.gov/angina.html,Angina is chest pain or discomfort you feel when there is not enough blood flow to your heart muscle. Your heart muscle needs the oxygen that the blood carries. Angina may feel like pressure or a squeezing pain in your chest. It may feel like indigestion. You may also feel pain in your shoulders; arms; neck; jaw; or back. Angina is a symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD); the most common heart disease. CAD happens when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to the heart; reducing blood flow.There are three types of angina:Stable angina is the most common type. It happens when the heart is working harder than usual. Stable angina has a regular pattern.  Rest and medicines usually help.Unstable angina is the most dangerous. It does not follow a pattern and can happen without physical exertion. It does not go away with rest or medicine. It is a sign that you could have a heart attack soon.Variant angina is rare. It happens when you are resting. Medicines can help.Not all chest pain or discomfort is angina.  If you have chest pain; you should see your health care provider.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Metabolic Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/metabolicsyndrome.html,Metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions that put you at risk for heart disease and diabetes. These conditions are  High blood pressureHigh blood glucose; or blood sugar; levelsHigh levels of triglycerides; a type of fat; in your blood Low levels of HDL; the good cholesterol; in your bloodToo much fat around your waistNot all doctors agree on the definition or cause of metabolic syndrome. The cause might be insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone your body produces to help you turn sugar from food into energy for your body. If you are insulin resistant; too much sugar builds up in your blood; setting the stage for disease.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Syphilis,https://medlineplus.gov/syphilis.html,Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by bacteria. It infects the genital area; lips; mouth; or anus of both men and women. You usually get syphilis from sexual contact with someone who has it. It can also pass from mother to baby during pregnancy.The early stage of syphilis usually causes a single; small; painless sore. Sometimes it causes swelling in nearby lymph nodes. If you do not treat it; syphilis usually causes a non-itchy skin rash; often on your hands and feet. Many people do not notice symptoms for years. Symptoms can go away and come back.The sores caused by syphilis make it easier to get or give someone HIV during sex. If you are pregnant; syphilis can cause birth defects; or you could lose your baby. In rare cases; syphilis causes serious health problems and even death.Syphilis is easy to cure with antibiotics if you catch it early. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces; but does not completely eliminate; the risk of catching or spreading syphilis.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Syringomyelia,https://medlineplus.gov/syringomyelia.html,Syringomyelia is a rare disorder that causes a cyst to form in your spinal cord. This cyst; called a syrinx; gets bigger and longer over time; destroying part of the spinal cord.  Damage to the spinal cord from the syrinx can cause symptoms such as Pain and weakness in the back; shoulders; arms or legsHeadachesInability to feel hot or coldSymptoms vary according to the size and location of the syrinx. They often begin in early adulthood. Syringomyelia usually results from a skull abnormality called a Chiari I malformation. A tumor; meningitis or physical trauma can also cause it. Surgery is the main treatment. Some people also need to have the syrinx drained. Medicines can help ease pain. In some cases; there are no symptoms; so you may not need treatment.
Lupus,https://medlineplus.gov/lupus.html,What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body; including the joints; skin; kidneys; heart; lungs; blood vessels; and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe; and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus; which is rare; affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.Who gets lupus?Anyone can get lupus; but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in Caucasian women. It's also more common in Hispanic; Asian; and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is not known.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms; and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes; most often on the face (also called the "butterfly rash")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms; it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.How do I know if I have lupus?There is no single test to diagnose lupus; and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:Medical historyComplete examBlood testsSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)What are the treatments for lupus?There is no cure for lupus; but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example; if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels; you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.The goals of the treatment plan are toPrevent flaresTreat flares when they occurReduce organ damage and other problemsTreatments may include drugs toReduce swelling and painPrevent or reduce flaresHelp the immune systemReduce or prevent damage to jointsBalance the hormonesBesides taking medicines for lupus; you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol; high blood pressure; or infection.Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time; no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.How can I cope with lupus?It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Scleroderma,https://medlineplus.gov/scleroderma.html,Scleroderma means hard skin. It is a group of diseases that cause abnormal growth of connective tissue.  Connective tissue is the material inside your body that gives your tissues their shape and helps keep them strong. In scleroderma; the tissue gets hard or thick. It can cause swelling or pain in your muscles and joints.Symptoms of scleroderma include Calcium deposits in connective tissues Raynaud's phenomenon; a narrowing of  blood vessels in the hands or feetSwelling of the esophagus; the tube between your throat and stomachThick; tight skin on your fingersRed spots on your hands and face No one knows what causes scleroderma. It is more common in women. It can be mild or severe. Doctors diagnose scleroderma using your medical history; a physical exam; lab tests; and a skin biopsy. There is no cure; but various treatments can control symptoms and complications. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Aortic Aneurysm,https://medlineplus.gov/aorticaneurysm.html,An aneurysm is a bulge or "ballooning" in the wall of an artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to other parts of the body. If an aneurysm grows large; it can burst and cause dangerous bleeding or even death.Most aneurysms are in the aorta; the main artery that runs from the heart through the chest and abdomen.There are two types of aortic aneurysm:Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) - these occur in the part of the aorta running through the chestAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) - these occur in the part of the aorta running through the abdomenMost aneurysms are found during tests done for other reasons. Some people are at high risk for aneurysms. It is important for them to get screening; because aneurysms can develop and become large before causing any symptoms. Screening is recommended for people between the ages of 65 and 75 if they have a family history; or if they are men who have smoked. Doctors use imaging tests to find aneurysms. Medicines and surgery are the two main treatments.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Arrhythmia,https://medlineplus.gov/arrhythmia.html,An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. It means that your heart beats too quickly; too slowly; or with an irregular pattern. When the heart beats faster than normal; it is called tachycardia. When the heart beats too slowly; it is called bradycardia. The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation; which causes an irregular and fast heart beat.Many factors can affect your heart's rhythm; such as having had a heart attack; smoking; congenital heart defects; and stress. Some substances or medicines may also cause arrhythmias. Symptoms of arrhythmias includeFast or slow heart beatSkipping beatsLightheadedness or dizzinessChest painShortness of breath Sweating Your doctor can run tests to find out if you have an arrhythmia. Treatment to restore a normal heart rhythm may include medicines; an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker; or sometimes surgery. NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Breathing Problems,https://medlineplus.gov/breathingproblems.html,When you're short of breath; it's hard or uncomfortable for you to take in the oxygen your body needs. You may feel as if you're not getting enough air. Sometimes you can have mild breathing problems because of a stuffy nose or intense exercise. But shortness of breath can also be a sign of a serious disease.Many conditions can make you feel short of breath:Lung conditions such as asthma; emphysema; or pneumoniaProblems with your trachea or bronchi; which are part of your airway systemHeart disease can make you feel breathless if your heart cannot pump enough blood to supply oxygen to your bodyAnxiety and panic attacksAllergiesIf you often have trouble breathing; it is important to find out the cause.
Tailbone Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/tailbonedisorders.html,The tailbone is the small bone at the bottom of your backbone; or spine. Tailbone disorders include tailbone injuries; pain; infections; cysts and tumors.  You rarely break your tailbone. Instead; most injuries cause bruises or pulled ligaments. A backward fall onto a hard surface; such as slipping on ice; is the most common cause of such injuries.   Symptoms of various tailbone disorders include pain in the tailbone area; pain upon sitting; pain or numbness in the arms or legs due to pressure on nerves in the tailbone area; and a mass or growth you can see or feel.
Talking With Your Doctor,https://medlineplus.gov/talkingwithyourdoctor.html,How well you and your doctor communicate with each other is one of the most important parts of getting good health care. Being prepared can help make the most of your visit. Here are some things you can bring:Lists of your concerns; any allergies and all the medicines; herbs; or vitamins you takeA description of symptoms - when they started; what makes them better A trusted friend or family memberA way to take notes during your appointmentMake sure you understand your diagnosis and any treatments. Ask your health care provider to write down his or her instructions to you. If you still have trouble understanding; ask where you can go for more information.
Tanning,https://medlineplus.gov/tanning.html,Can a tan be healthy?Some people think that tanning gives them a healthy glow. But tanning; either outdoors or indoors with a tanning bed; is not healthy at all. It exposes you to harmful rays and puts you at risk for health problems such as melanoma and other skin cancers.What are UV rays; and how do they affect the skin?Sunlight travels to earth as a mixture of both visible and invisible rays. Some of the rays are harmless to people. But one kind; ultraviolet (UV) rays; can cause problems. They are a form of radiation. UV rays do help your body make vitamin D; but too much exposure damages your skin. Most people can get the vitamin D that they need with only about 5 to 15 minutes of sun exposure two to three times a week.There are three types of UV rays. Two of them; UVA and UVB; can reach the earth's surface and affect your skin. Using a tanning bed also exposes you to UVA and UVB.UVB rays can cause sunburn. UVA rays can travel more deeply into the skin than UVB rays. When your skin is exposed to UVA; it tries to protect itself from further damage. It does this by making more melanin; which is the skin pigment that makes your skin darker. That's what gives you a tan. This means that your tan is a sign of skin damage.What are the health risks of tanning?Since tanning means overexposure to UV rays; it can damage your skin and cause health problems such asPremature skin aging; which can cause your skin to become thickened; leathery; and wrinkled. You may also have dark spots on your skin. These happen because long-term exposure to UV rays makes your skin less elastic. The more sun exposure you have; the earlier your skin ages.Skin cancers; including melanoma. This can happen because the UV light damages the DNA of your skin cells and interferes with your body's ability to fight the cancer.Actinic keratosis; a thick; scaly patch of skin that usually forms on areas exposed to the sun; such as the face; scalp; back of the hands; or chest. It can eventually become cancerous.Eye damage; including cataracts and photokeratitis (snow blindness)A weakened immune system; which can increase your sensitivity to sunlight; decrease the effects of immunizations; and cause you to have reactions to certain medicines.What should I do to protect my skin from UV rays?Limit sun exposure. Try to stay out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.; when its rays are strongest. But remember that you still get sun exposure when you are outside on cloudy days or are in the shade.Use sunscreen with sun protective factor (SPF) 15 or higher. It should also be a broad spectrum sunscreen; which means that it gives you both UVA and UVB protection. If you have very light skin; use SPF 30 or higher. Apply sunscreen 20-30 minutes before going outside; and reapply it at least every 2 hours.Wear sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays. Wrap-around sunglasses work best because they block UV rays from sneaking in from the side.Wear a hat. You can get the best protection with a wide-brimmed hat that is made out of a tightly woven fabric; such as canvas.Wear protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts and long pants and skirts. Clothes made from tightly woven fabric offer the best protection.It is also important to check your skin once a month. If you do see any new or changing spots or moles; go see your health care provider.Isn't indoor tanning safer than tanning in the sun?Indoor tanning is not better than tanning in the sun; it also exposes you to UV rays and damages your skin. Tanning beds use UVA light; so they expose you to a higher concentration of UVA rays than you would get by tanning in the sun. Tanning lights also expose you to some UVB rays.Some people think that getting a "base tan" in a tanning salon can protect you when you go in the sun. But a "base tan" causes damage to your skin and will not prevent you from getting sunburn when you go outside.Indoor tanning is particularly dangerous for younger people. You have a higher risk of melanoma if you started doing indoor tanning while you were a teen or young adult.Some research shows that frequent tanning may even be addictive. This can be dangerous because the more often you tan; the more damage you do to your skin.Are there safer ways to look tan?There are other ways to look tan; but they are not all safe:Tanning pills have a color additive that turns your skin orange after you take them. But they can be dangerous and are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Sunless tanners have no known risk for skin cancer; but you do have to be careful. Most spray tans; lotions; and gels use DHA; a color additive that makes your skin look tan. DHA is considered safe for use on the outside of your body by the FDA. You need to make sure it doesn't get into your nose; eyes; or mouth. If you use a spray tan; be careful not to breathe in the spray. Also; remember that these "tans" do not protect you from UV rays when you go outside.

Then mental and physical abilities decline. The child becomes blind; deaf; and unable to swallow. Muscles begin to waste away and paralysis sets in. Even with the best of care; children with Tay-Sachs disease usually die by age 4.The cause is a gene mutation which is most common in Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews. To get the disease; both parents must have the gene.  If they do; there is a 25% chance of the child having the disease. A blood test and prenatal tests can check for the gene or the disease.There is no cure. Medicines and good nutrition can help some symptoms.

Biodefense and Bioterrorism,https://medlineplus.gov/biodefenseandbioterrorism.html,A bioterrorism attack is the deliberate release of viruses; bacteria; or other germs to cause illness or death. These germs are often found in nature. But they can sometimes be made more harmful by increasing their ability to cause disease; spread; or resist medical treatment.Biological agents spread through the air; water; or in food. Some can also spread from person to person. They can be very hard to detect. They don't cause illness for several hours or days. Scientists worry that anthrax; botulism; Ebola and other hemorrhagic fever viruses; plague; or smallpox could be used as biological agents.Biodefense uses medical measures to protect people against bioterrorism. This includes medicines and vaccinations. It also includes medical research and preparations to defend against bioterrorist attacks.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

People who are elderly; very young; taking certain medications; or have a chronic illness have a greater risk.Signs of dehydration in adults includeBeing thirstyUrinating less often than usualDark-colored urineDry skinFeeling tiredDizziness and faintingSigns of dehydration in babies and young children include a dry mouth and tongue; crying without tears; no wet diapers for 3 hours or more; a high fever and being unusually sleepy or drowsy.If you think you're dehydrated; drink small amounts of water over a period of time. Drinking too much all at once can overload your stomach and make you throw up. If you are exercising in the heat and losing a lot of minerals in sweat; sports drinks can be helpful. Avoid any drinks that have caffeine.NIH: National Institutes of Health
Pleural Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/pleuraldisorders.html,Your pleura is a large; thin sheet of tissue that wraps around the outside of your lungs and lines the inside of your chest cavity. Between the layers of the pleura is a very thin space. Normally it's filled with a small amount of fluid. The fluid helps the two layers of the pleura glide smoothly past each other as your lungs breathe air in and out.Disorders of the pleura includePleurisy - inflammation of the pleura that causes sharp pain with breathingPleural effusion - excess fluid in the pleural spacePneumothorax - buildup of air or gas in the pleural spaceHemothorax - buildup of blood in the pleural spaceMany different conditions can cause pleural problems. Viral infection is the most common cause of pleurisy. The most common cause of pleural effusion is congestive heart failure. Lung diseases; like COPD; tuberculosis; and acute lung injury; cause pneumothorax. Injury to the chest is the most common cause of hemothorax. Treatment focuses on removing fluid; air; or blood from the pleural space; relieving symptoms; and treating the underlying condition.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Aortic Aneurysm,https://medlineplus.gov/aorticaneurysm.html,An aneurysm is a bulge or "ballooning" in the wall of an artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to other parts of the body. If an aneurysm grows large; it can burst and cause dangerous bleeding or even death.Most aneurysms are in the aorta; the main artery that runs from the heart through the chest and abdomen.There are two types of aortic aneurysm:Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) - these occur in the part of the aorta running through the chestAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) - these occur in the part of the aorta running through the abdomenMost aneurysms are found during tests done for other reasons. Some people are at high risk for aneurysms. It is important for them to get screening; because aneurysms can develop and become large before causing any symptoms. Screening is recommended for people between the ages of 65 and 75 if they have a family history; or if they are men who have smoked. Doctors use imaging tests to find aneurysms. Medicines and surgery are the two main treatments.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

Thoracic Outlet Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/thoracicoutletsyndrome.html,Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) causes pain in the shoulder; arm; and neck. It happens when the nerves or blood vessels just below your neck are compressed; or squeezed. The compression can happen between the muscles of your neck and shoulder or between the first rib and collarbone. You may feel burning; tingling; and numbness along your arm; hand; and fingers. If a nerve is compressed; you may also feel weakness in your hand. If a vein is compressed; your hand might be sensitive to cold; or turn pale or bluish. Your arm might swell and tire easily.TOS is more common in women.  It usually starts between 20 and 50 years of age.  Doctors do nerve and imaging studies to diagnose it.There are many causes of TOS; includingInjuryAnatomical defectsTumors that press on nervesPoor posture that causes nerve compressionPregnancyRepetitive arm and shoulder movements and activity; such as from playing certain sportsTreatment depends on what caused your TOS. Medicines; physical therapy; and relaxation might help. Surgery may also be an option. Most people recover.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

It can cause miscarriage or birth defects.Rubella spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. People without symptoms can still spread it. There is no treatment; but the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine can prevent it.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Throat Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/throatcancer.html,Throat cancer is a type of head and neck cancer. Throat cancer has different names; depending on which part of the throat is affected. The different parts of your throat are called the oropharynx; the hypopharynx; the nasopharynx; and the larynx; or voice box.The main risk factors for throat cancer are using tobacco heavy drinking. Certain types of throat cancer also have other risk factors. For example; having HPV is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer.Symptoms of throat cancer may includeA sore throat that does not go awayA lump in the neckPain or ringing in the earsTrouble swallowingEar painTo diagnose throat cancers; doctors may do a physical exam and history; imaging tests; and a biopsy. You may also need other tests; depending on the type of cancer. Treatments include surgery; radiation therapy; and chemotherapy. Treatment for some types of throat cancer may also include targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Throat Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/throatdisorders.html,Your throat is a tube that carries food to your esophagus and air to your windpipe and larynx. The technical name for your throat is the pharynx. Throat problems are common. You've probably had a sore throat. The cause is usually a viral infection; but other causes include allergies; infection with strep  bacteria or the leaking of stomach acids back up into the esophagus; called GERD. Other problems that affect the throat includeTonsillitis - inflammation of the tonsilsCancer Croup - inflammation; usually in small children; which causes a barking coughLaryngitis - swelling of the voice box; which can cause a hoarse voice or loss of voiceMost throat problems are minor and go away on their own. Treatments; when needed; depend on the problem.
Platelet Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/plateletdisorders.html,Platelets are little pieces of blood cells. Platelets help wounds heal and prevent bleeding by forming blood clots. Your bone marrow makes platelets.  Problems can result from having too few or too many platelets; or from platelets that do not work properly.If your blood has a low number of platelets; it is called thrombocytopenia. This can put you at risk for mild to serious bleeding.   If your blood has too many platelets; you may have a higher risk of blood clots.  With other platelet disorders; the platelets do not work as they should.  For example; in von Willebrand Disease; the platelets cannot stick together or cannot attach to blood vessel walls.  This can cause excessive bleeding.  Treatment of platelet disorders depends on the cause.  NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Blood Clots,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodclots.html,Normally; if you get hurt; your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding. After the bleeding stops and healing takes place; your body usually breaks down and removes the clot. But some people get too many clots or their blood clots abnormally. Many conditions can cause the blood to clot too much or prevent blood clots from dissolving properly.Risk factors for excessive blood clotting includeCertain genetic disordersAtherosclerosisDiabetesAtrial fibrillationOverweight; obesity; and metabolic syndromeSome medicinesSmokingStaying in one position for a long time; such as being in the hospital or taking a long car or plane rideCancer and cancer treatmentsBlood clots can form in; or travel to; the blood vessels in the brain; heart; kidneys; lungs; and limbs. A clot in the veins deep in the limbs is called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT usually affects the deep veins of the legs. If a blood clot in a deep vein breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs and blocks blood flow; it is called a pulmonary embolism. Other complications of blood clots include stroke; heart attack; kidney problems; kidney failure; and pregnancy-related problems.Treatments for blood clots include blood thinners and other medicines.
Yeast Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/yeastinfections.html,Candida is the scientific name for yeast. It is a fungus that lives almost everywhere; including in your body.

Thyroid Tests,https://medlineplus.gov/thyroidtests.html,Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck; just above your collarbone. It is one of your endocrine glands; which make hormones. Thyroid hormones control the rate of many activities in your body. They include how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats. Thyroid tests check how well your thyroid is working. They are also used to diagnose and help find the cause of thyroid diseases such as hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Thyroid tests include blood tests and imaging tests.Blood tests for your thyroid includeTSH - measures thyroid-stimulating hormone. It is the most accurate measure of thyroid activity.T3 and T4 - measure different thyroid hormones.TSI - measures thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin.Antithyroid antibody test - measures antibodies (markers in the blood).Imaging tests include CT scans; ultrasound; and nuclear medicine tests. One type of nuclear medicine test is the thyroid scan. It uses small amounts of radioactive material to create a picture of the thyroid; showing its size; shape; and position. It can help find the cause of hyperthyroidism and check for thyroid nodules (lumps in the thyroid). Another nuclear test is the radioactive iodine uptake test; or thyroid uptake test. It checks how well your thyroid is working and can help find the cause of hyperthyroidism. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Hyperthyroidism,https://medlineplus.gov/hyperthyroidism.html,Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck; just above your collarbone. It is one of your endocrine glands; which make hormones. Thyroid hormones control the rate of many activities in your body. These include how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats. All of these activities are your body's metabolism. If your thyroid is too active; it makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs. This is called hyperthyroidism.Hyperthyroidism is more common in women; people with other thyroid problems; and those over 60 years old. Graves' disease; an autoimmune disorder; is the most common cause.  Other causes include thyroid nodules; thyroiditis; consuming too much iodine; and taking too much synthetic thyroid hormone.The symptoms can vary from person to person.  They may includeBeing nervous or irritableMood swingsFatigue or muscle weaknessHeat intoleranceTrouble sleepingHand tremorsRapid and irregular heartbeatFrequent bowel movements or diarrheaWeight lossGoiter; which is an enlarged thyroid that may cause the neck to look swollenTo diagnose hyperthyroidism; your doctor will do a physical exam; look at your symptoms; and do thyroid tests.

Tonsillitis,https://medlineplus.gov/tonsillitis.html,What are tonsils?Tonsils are lumps of tissue at the back of the throat. There are two of them; one on each side. Along with the adenoids; tonsils are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance.  Tonsils and adenoids work by trapping the germs coming in through the mouth and nose.What is tonsillitis?Tonsillitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the tonsils. Sometimes along with tonsillitis; the adenoids are also swollen.What causes tonsillitis?The cause of tonsillitis is usually a viral infection. Bacterial infections such as strep throat can also cause tonsillitis.Who gets tonsillitis?Tonsillitis is most common in children over age two. Almost every child in the United States gets it at least once. Tonsillitis caused by bacteria is more common in kids ages 5-15. Tonsillitis caused by a virus is more common in younger children.Adults can get tonsillitis; but it is not very common.Is tonsillitis contagious?Although tonsillitis is not contagious; the viruses and bacteria that cause it are contagious. Frequent handwashing can help prevent spreading or catching the infections.What are the symptoms of tonsillitis?The symptoms of tonsillitis includeA sore throat; which may be severeRed; swollen tonsilsTrouble swallowingA white or yellow coating on the tonsilsSwollen glands in the neckFeverBad breathWhen should I get medical help for my child?You should call your health care provider if your childHas a sore throat for more than two daysHas trouble or pain when swallowingFeels very sick or very weakYou should get emergency care right away if your childHas trouble breathingStarts droolingHas a lot of trouble swallowingHow is tonsillitis diagnosed?To diagnose tonsillitis; your child's health care provider will first ask you about your child's symptoms and medical history. The provider will look at your child's throat and neck; checking for things such as redness or white spots on the tonsils and swollen lymph nodes.Your child will probably also have one or more tests to check for strep throat; since it can cause tonsillitis and it requires treatment. It could be a rapid strep test; a throat culture; or both. For both tests; the provider uses a cotton swab to collect a sample of fluids from your child's tonsils and the back of the throat. With the rapid strep test; testing is done in the office; and you get the results within minutes. The throat culture is done in a lab; and it usually takes a few days to get the results. The throat culture is a more reliable test. So sometimes if the rapid strep test is negative (meaning that it does not show any strep bacteria); the provider will also do a throat culture just to make sure that your child does not have strep.What are the treatments for tonsillitis?Treatment for tonsillitis depends on the cause. If the cause is a virus; there is no medicine to treat it. If the cause is a bacterial infection; such as strep throat; your child will need to take antibiotics. It is important for your child to finish the antibiotics even if he or she feels better. If treatment stops too soon; some bacteria may survive and re-infect your child.No matter what is causing the tonsillitis; there are some things you can do to help your child feel better. Make sure that your childGets a lot of restDrinks plenty of fluidsTries eating soft foods if it hurts to swallowTries eating warm liquids or cold foods like popsicles to soothe the throatIsn't around cigarette smoke or do anything else that could irritate the throatSleeps in a room with a humidifierGargles with saltwaterSucks on a lozenge (but do not give them to children under four; they can choke on them)Takes an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen.

Sepsis,https://medlineplus.gov/sepsis.html,Sepsis is a serious illness. It happens when your body has an overwhelming immune response to a bacterial infection.  The chemicals released into the blood to fight the infection trigger widespread inflammation. This leads to blood clots and leaky blood vessels. They cause poor blood flow; which deprives your body's organs of nutrients and oxygen. In severe cases; one or more organs fail. In the worst cases; blood pressure drops and the heart weakens; leading to septic shock.Anyone can get sepsis; but the risk is higher inPeople with weakened immune systemsInfants and childrenThe elderlyPeople with chronic illnesses; such as diabetes; AIDS; cancer; and kidney or liver diseasePeople suffering from a severe burn or physical traumaCommon symptoms of sepsis are fever; chills; rapid breathing and heart rate; rash; confusion; and disorientation. Doctors diagnose sepsis using a blood test to see if the number of white blood cells is abnormal. They also do lab tests that check for signs of infection.People with sepsis are usually treated in hospital intensive care units. Doctors try to treat the infection; sustain the vital organs; and prevent a drop in blood pressure. Many patients receive oxygen and intravenous (IV) fluids. Other types of treatment; such as respirators or kidney dialysis; may be necessary. Sometimes; surgery is needed to clear up an infection.NIH: National Institute of General Medical Sciences

Tracheal Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/trachealdisorders.html,Your trachea; or windpipe; is one part of your airway system. Airways are pipes that carry oxygen-rich air to your lungs. They also carry carbon dioxide; a waste gas; out of your lungs. When you inhale; air travels from your nose; through your larynx; and down your windpipe. The windpipe splits into two bronchi that enter your lungs.Problems with the trachea include narrowing; inflammation; and some inherited conditions.  You may need a procedure called a tracheostomy to help you breathe if you have swallowing problems; or have conditions that affect coughing or block your airways.  You might also need a tracheostomy if you are in critical care and need to be on a breathing machine.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Critical Care,https://medlineplus.gov/criticalcare.html,Critical care helps people with life-threatening injuries and illnesses.

Half of all TBIs are from motor vehicle accidents. Military personnel in combat zones are also at risk.Symptoms of a TBI may not appear until days or weeks following the injury. A concussion is the mildest type. It can cause a headache or neck pain; nausea; ringing in the ears; dizziness; and tiredness.  People with a moderate or severe TBI may have those; plus other symptoms:A headache that gets worse or does not go awayRepeated vomiting or nauseaConvulsions or seizuresInability to awaken from sleepSlurred speechWeakness or numbness in the arms and legsDilated eye pupilsHealth care professionals use a neurological exam and imaging tests to assess TBI. Serious traumatic brain injuries need emergency treatment. Treatment and outcome depend on how severe the injury is. TBI can cause a wide range of changes affecting thinking; sensation; language; or emotions. TBI can be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder. People with severe injuries usually need rehabilitation. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Traveler's Health,https://medlineplus.gov/travelershealth.html,Traveling can increase your chances of getting sick. A long flight can increase your risk for deep vein thrombosis.

But the longer you have it; the less often it goes away.TN usually affects people over 50; especially women. The cause is probably a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve; one of the largest nerves in the head. Tumors and multiple sclerosis can also cause TN; but in some cases the cause is unknown.There is no single test to diagnose TN. It can be hard to diagnose; since many other conditions can cause facial pain. Treatment options include medicines; surgery; and complementary techniques.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Triglycerides,https://medlineplus.gov/triglycerides.html,Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood.

Twins, Triplets, Multiple Births,https://medlineplus.gov/twinstripletsmultiplebirths.html,If you are pregnant with more than one baby; you are far from alone. Multiple births are up in the United States.  More women are having babies after age 30 and more are taking fertility drugs. Both boost the chance of carrying more than one baby. A family history of twins also makes multiples more likely.Years ago; most twins came as a surprise. Now; most women know about a multiple pregnancy early. Women with multiple pregnancies should see their health care providers more often than women who are expecting one baby. Multiple pregnancy babies have a much higher risk of being born prematurely and having a low birth weight.  There is also more of a risk of disabilities. Some women have to go on bed rest to delay labor. Finally; they may deliver by C-section; especially if there are three babies or more.Parenting multiples can be a challenge. Volunteer help and support groups for parents of multiples can help.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health

With support and treatment; many people with Down syndrome live happy; productive lives.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Traveler's Health,https://medlineplus.gov/travelershealth.html,Traveling can increase your chances of getting sick. A long flight can increase your risk for deep vein thrombosis. Once you arrive; it takes time to adjust to the water; food; and air in another place. Water in developing countries can contain viruses; bacteria; and parasites that cause stomach upset and diarrhea. Be safe by using only bottled or purified water for drinking; making ice cubes; and brushing your teeth. If you use tap water; boil it or use iodine tablets. Food poisoning can also be a risk. Eat only food that is fully cooked and served hot.  Avoid unwashed or unpeeled raw fruits and vegetables.If you are traveling out of the country; you might also need vaccinations or medicines to prevent specific illnesses. Which ones you need will depend on what part of the world you're visiting; the time of year; your age; overall health status; and previous immunizations. See your doctor 4 to 6 weeks before your trip. Most vaccines take time to become effective. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Tuberous Sclerosis,https://medlineplus.gov/tuberoussclerosis.html,Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disease that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain and other organs. Symptoms vary; depending on where the tumors grow. They could includeSkin problems; such as light patches and thickened skinSeizuresBehavior problemsIntellectual disabilitiesKidney problemsSome people have signs of tuberous sclerosis at birth. In others it can take time for the symptoms to develop. The disease can be mild; or it can cause severe disabilities. In rare cases; tumors in vital organs or other symptoms can be life-threatening.Tuberous sclerosis has no cure; but treatments can help symptoms. Options include medicines; educational and occupational therapy; surgery; or surgery to treat specific complications.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Tsunamis,https://medlineplus.gov/tsunamis.html,A tsunami is a series of huge ocean waves created by an underwater disturbance. Causes include earthquakes; landslides; volcanic eruptions; or meteorites--chunks of rock from space that strike the surface of Earth.   A tsunami can move hundreds of miles per hour in the open ocean. It can smash into land with waves as high as 100 feet or more and cause devastating floods. Drowning is the most common cause of death related to a tsunami.Although there are no guarantees of safety during a tsunami; you can take actions to protect yourself.  You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear; anxiety; and losses. If you do experience a disaster; it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.Federal Emergency Management Agency
Tubal Ligation,https://medlineplus.gov/tuballigation.html,Tubal ligation (getting your "tubes tied") is a type of surgery. It prevents a woman from getting pregnant. It is a permanent form of birth control; and is effective right away.The surgery cuts; ties; or seals the fallopian tubes. This blocks the path between the ovaries and the uterus. The sperm cannot reach the egg to fertilize it; and the egg cannot reach the uterus. You get the surgery in a hospital or outpatient surgical center. It usually takes about 30 minutes. Almost all women go home the same day. They can return to most normal activities within a few days.Tubal ligation can sometimes be reversed. The reversal is major surgery; and does not always work.
Ectopic Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/ectopicpregnancy.html,The uterus; or womb; is the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant. If you have an ectopic pregnancy; the fertilized egg grows in the wrong place; outside the uterus; usually in the fallopian tubes. The result is usually a miscarriage.Ectopic pregnancy can be a medical emergency if it ruptures. Signs of ectopic pregnancy includeAbdominal painShoulder painVaginal bleedingFeeling dizzy or faintGet medical care right away if you have these signs. Doctors use drugs or surgery to remove the ectopic tissue so it doesn't damage your organs. Many women who have had ectopic pregnancies go on to have healthy pregnancies later.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Tuberculosis,https://medlineplus.gov/tuberculosis.html,Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  The bacteria usually attack the lungs; but they can also damage other parts of the body. TB spreads through the air when a person with TB of the lungs or throat coughs; sneezes; or talks.  If you have been exposed; you should go to your doctor for tests. You are more likely to get TB if you have a weak immune system.Symptoms of TB in the lungs may include A bad cough that lasts 3 weeks or longer Weight loss Loss of appetite Coughing up blood or mucus Weakness or fatigue  Fever Night sweatsSkin tests; blood tests; x-rays; and other tests can tell if you have TB. If not treated properly; TB can be deadly. You can usually cure active TB by taking several medicines for a long period of time.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

Biodefense and Bioterrorism,https://medlineplus.gov/biodefenseandbioterrorism.html,A bioterrorism attack is the deliberate release of viruses; bacteria; or other germs to cause illness or death. These germs are often found in nature. But they can sometimes be made more harmful by increasing their ability to cause disease; spread; or resist medical treatment.Biological agents spread through the air; water; or in food. Some can also spread from person to person. They can be very hard to detect. They don't cause illness for several hours or days. Scientists worry that anthrax; botulism; Ebola and other hemorrhagic fever viruses; plague; or smallpox could be used as biological agents.Biodefense uses medical measures to protect people against bioterrorism. This includes medicines and vaccinations. It also includes medical research and preparations to defend against bioterrorist attacks.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Tick Bites,https://medlineplus.gov/tickbites.html,If you spend time outdoors or have pets that go outdoors; you need to beware of ticks. Ticks are small bloodsucking parasites. Many species transmit diseases to animals and people. Some of the diseases you can get from a tick bite are Lyme disease; ehrlichiosis; Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.  Some ticks are so small that they can be difficult to see. Ticks may get on you if you walk through areas where they live; such as tall grass; leaf litter or shrubs.  Tick-borne diseases occur worldwide; including in your own backyard. To help protect yourself and your family; you should   Use a chemical repellent with DEET; permethrin or picaridin  Wear light-colored protective clothing   Tuck pant legs into socks   Avoid tick-infested areas   Check yourself; your children and your pets daily for ticks and carefully remove any ticks you find
Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/cancer.html,Cancer begins in your cells; which are the building blocks of your body.   Normally; your body forms new cells as you need them; replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them; and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example; lung cancer starts in the lung; and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery; radiation and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy; immunotherapy or other types of biologic therapy; or stem cell transplantation. NIH: National Cancer Institute
Tumors and Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/tumorsandpregnancy.html,Tumors during pregnancy are rare; but they can happen. Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. The most common cancers in pregnancy are breast cancer; cervical cancer; lymphoma; and melanoma.  Cancer itself rarely harms the baby; and some cancer treatments are safe during pregnancy.  You and your health care provider will work together to find the best treatment.  Your options will depend on how far along the pregnancy is; as well as the type; size; and stage of your cancer.Another type of tumor that women can get is called a gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). It happens when a fertilized egg doesn't become a fetus.  GTD is not always easy to find.  It is usually benign; but some types can be malignant. The most common type of GTD is a molar pregnancy. In its early stages; it may look like a normal pregnancy. You should see your health care provider if you have vaginal bleeding (not menstrual bleeding). Treatment depends on the type of tumor; whether it has spread to other places; and your overall health.
Benign Tumors,https://medlineplus.gov/benigntumors.html,Tumors are abnormal growths in your body. They can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. Benign tumors grow only in one place. They cannot spread or invade other parts of your body. Even so; they can be dangerous if they press on vital organs; such as your brain.Tumors are made up of extra cells. Normally; cells grow and divide to form new cells as your body needs them. When cells grow old; they die; and new cells take their place. Sometimes; this process goes wrong. New cells form when your body does not need them; and old cells do not die when they should. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form tumor.Treatment often involves surgery. Benign tumors usually don't grow back.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Turner Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/turnersyndrome.html,Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects a girl's development. The cause is a missing or incomplete X chromosome. Girls who have it are short; and their ovaries don't work properly.Other physical features typical of Turner syndrome areShort; "webbed" neck with folds of skin from tops of shoulders to sides of neckLow hairline in the backLow-set earsSwollen hands and feetMost women with Turner syndrome are infertile. They are at risk for health difficulties such as high blood pressure; kidney problems; diabetes; cataracts; osteoporosis; and thyroid problems.Doctors diagnose Turner syndrome based on symptoms and a genetic test. Sometimes it is found in prenatal testing. There is no cure for Turner syndrome; but there are some treatments for the symptoms. Growth hormone often helps girls reach heights that are close to average. Hormone replacement can help start sexual development. Assisted reproduction techniques can help some women with Turner syndrome get pregnant.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Twins, Triplets, Multiple Births,https://medlineplus.gov/twinstripletsmultiplebirths.html,If you are pregnant with more than one baby; you are far from alone. Multiple births are up in the United States.  More women are having babies after age 30 and more are taking fertility drugs. Both boost the chance of carrying more than one baby. A family history of twins also makes multiples more likely.Years ago; most twins came as a surprise. Now; most women know about a multiple pregnancy early. Women with multiple pregnancies should see their health care providers more often than women who are expecting one baby. Multiple pregnancy babies have a much higher risk of being born prematurely and having a low birth weight.  There is also more of a risk of disabilities. Some women have to go on bed rest to delay labor. Finally; they may deliver by C-section; especially if there are three babies or more.Parenting multiples can be a challenge. Volunteer help and support groups for parents of multiples can help.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
Diabetes Type 1,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype1.html,Diabetes means your blood glucose; or blood sugar; levels are too high.  With type 1 diabetes; your pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin; too much glucose stays in your blood.  Over time; high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart; eyes; kidneys; nerves; and gums and teeth. Type 1 diabetes happens most often in children and young adults but can appear at any age. Symptoms may includeBeing very thirsty Urinating often Feeling very hungry or tired Losing weight without trying Having sores that heal slowly Having dry; itchy skin Losing the feeling in your feet or having tingling in your feet Having blurry eyesight A blood test can show if you have diabetes. If you do; you will need to take insulin for the rest of your life. A blood test called the A1C can check to see how well you are managing your diabetes.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Diabetes Type 2,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype2.html,Diabetes means your blood glucose; or blood sugar; levels are too high.  With type 2 diabetes; the more common type; your body does not make or use insulin well. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin; too much glucose stays in your blood.  Over time; high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart; eyes; kidneys; nerves; and gums and teeth.You have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if you are older; have obesity; have a family history of diabetes; or do not exercise. Having prediabetes also increases your risk.  Prediabetes means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. If you are at risk for type 2 diabetes; you may be able to delay or prevent developing it by making some lifestyle changes.The symptoms of type 2 diabetes appear slowly.  Some people do not notice symptoms at all.  The symptoms can includeBeing very thirstyUrinating oftenFeeling very hungry or tiredLosing weight without tryingHaving sores that heal slowlyHaving blurry eyesightBlood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test; the A1C; can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Many people can manage their diabetes through healthy eating; physical activity; and blood glucose testing.  Some people also need to take diabetes medicines.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Salmonella Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/salmonellainfections.html,Salmonella is the name of a group of bacteria. In the United States; it is a common cause of foodborne illness.  Salmonella occurs in raw poultry; eggs; beef; and sometimes on unwashed fruit and vegetables. You also can get infected after handling pets; especially reptiles like snakes; turtles; and lizards.Symptoms includeFeverDiarrheaAbdominal crampsHeadachePossible nausea; vomiting; and loss of appetiteSymptoms usually last 4-7 days. Your health care provider diagnoses the infection with a stool test. Most people get better without treatment.  Infection can be more serious in the elderly; infants; and people with chronic health problems. If Salmonella gets into the bloodstream; it can be serious.  The usual treatment is antibiotics.Typhoid fever; a more serious disease caused by Salmonella; is not common in the United States. It frequently occurs in developing countries.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Leg Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/leginjuriesanddisorders.html,Your legs are made up of bones; blood vessels; muscles; and other connective tissue. They are important for motion and standing. Playing sports; running; falling; or having an accident can damage your legs. Common leg injuries include sprains and strains; joint dislocations; and fractures.These injuries can affect the entire leg; or just the foot; ankle; knee; or hip. Certain diseases also lead to leg problems. For example; knee osteoarthritis; common in older people; can cause pain and limited motion. Problems in your veins in your legs can lead to varicose veins or deep vein thrombosis.
Ulcerative Colitis,https://medlineplus.gov/ulcerativecolitis.html,Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease that causes inflammation and sores; called ulcers; in the lining of the rectum and colon. It is one of a group of diseases called inflammatory bowel disease.UC can happen at any age; but it usually starts between the ages of 15 and 30. It tends to run in families. The most common symptoms are pain in the abdomen and blood or pus in diarrhea. Other symptoms may includeAnemiaSevere tirednessWeight lossLoss of appetiteBleeding from the rectumSores on the skinJoint painGrowth failure in childrenAbout half of people with UC have mild symptoms.Doctors use blood tests; stool tests; colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy; and imaging tests to diagnose UC. Several types of drugs can help control it. Some people have long periods of remission; when they are free of symptoms. In severe cases; doctors must remove the colon.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Peptic Ulcer,https://medlineplus.gov/pepticulcer.html,A peptic ulcer is a sore in the lining of your stomach or your duodenum; the first part of your small intestine. A burning stomach pain is the most common symptom. The painStarts between meals or during the nightBriefly stops if you eat or take antacidsLasts for minutes to hoursComes and goes for several days or weeksPeptic ulcers happen when the acids that help you digest food damage the walls of the stomach or duodenum. The most common cause is infection with a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. Another cause is the long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Stress and spicy foods do not cause ulcers; but can make them worse. To see if you have an H. pylori infection; your doctor will test your blood; breath; or stool. Your doctor also may look inside your stomach and duodenum by doing an endoscopy or x-ray.Peptic ulcers will get worse if not treated. Treatment may include medicines to reduce stomach acids or antibiotics to kill H. pylori. Antacids and milk can't heal peptic ulcers. Not smoking and avoiding alcohol can help. You may need surgery if your ulcers don't heal.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Ultrasound,https://medlineplus.gov/ultrasound.html,Ultrasound is a type of imaging. It uses high-frequency sound waves to look at organs and structures inside the body. Health care professionals use it to view the heart; blood vessels; kidneys; liver; and other organs. During pregnancy; doctors use ultrasound to view the fetus. Unlike x-rays; ultrasound does not expose you to radiation.During an ultrasound test; you lie on a table. A special technician or doctor moves a device called a transducer over part of your body. The transducer sends out sound waves; which bounce off the tissues inside your body. The transducer also captures the waves that bounce back. The ultrasound machine creates images from the sound waves.
Sun Exposure,https://medlineplus.gov/sunexposure.html,Ultraviolet (UV) rays are an invisible form of radiation. They can pass through your skin and damage your skin cells. Sunburns are a sign of skin damage. Suntans aren't healthy; either. They appear after the sun's rays have already killed some cells and damaged others. UV rays can cause skin damage during any season or at any temperature.  They can also cause eye problems; wrinkles; skin spots; and skin cancer.To protect yourself Stay out of the sun when it is strongest (between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.)Use sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher Wear protective clothing Wear wraparound sunglasses that provide 100 percent UV ray protectionAvoid sunlamps and tanning beds Check your skin regularly for changes in the size; shape; color; or feel of birthmarks; moles; and spots. Such changes are a sign of skin cancer. Food and Drug Administration
Hernia,https://medlineplus.gov/hernia.html,A hernia happens when part of an internal organ or tissue bulges through a weak area of muscle.

You may need medicines to treat the symptoms.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Ureteral Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/ureteraldisorders.html,Your kidneys make urine by filtering wastes and extra water from your blood.  The urine travels from the kidneys to the bladder in two thin tubes called ureters.The ureters are about 8 to 10 inches long. Muscles in the ureter walls tighten and relax to force urine down and away from the kidneys. Small amounts of urine flow from the ureters into the bladder about every 10 to 15 seconds.Sometimes the ureters can become blocked or injured. This can block the flow of urine to the bladder. If urine stands still or backs up the ureter; you may get a urinary tract infections.Doctors diagnose problems with the ureters using different tests. These include urine tests; x-rays; and examination of the ureter with a scope called a cystoscope. Treatment depends on the cause of the problem.

It includes two kidneys; two ureters; a bladder; and a urethra. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common type of infection in the body.You may have a UTI if you noticePain or burning when you urinateFever; tiredness; or shakinessAn urge to urinate oftenPressure in your lower belly Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy or reddishPain in your back or side below the ribsPeople of any age or sex can get UTIs. But about four times as many women get UTIs as men. You're also at higher risk if you have diabetes; need a tube to drain your bladder; or have a spinal cord injury.If you think you have a UTI it is important to see your doctor. Your doctor can tell if you have a UTI with a urine test.  Treatment is with antibiotics. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Urine and Urination,https://medlineplus.gov/urineandurination.html,Your kidneys make urine by filtering wastes and extra water from your blood. The waste is called urea. Your blood carries it to the kidneys. From the kidneys; urine travels down two thin tubes called ureters to the bladder. The bladder stores urine until you are ready to urinate. It swells into a round shape when it is full and gets smaller when empty. If your urinary system is healthy; your bladder can hold up to 16 ounces (2 cups) of urine comfortably for 2 to 5 hours.You may have problems with urination if you haveKidney failureUrinary tract infections An enlarged prostateBladder control problems like  incontinence; overactive bladder; or interstitial cystitisA blockage that prevents you from emptying your bladder Some conditions may also cause you to have blood or protein in your urine. If you have a urinary problem; see your health care provider. Urinalysis and other urine tests can help to diagnose the problem. Treatment depends on the cause.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Urinalysis,https://medlineplus.gov/urinalysis.html,A urinalysis is a test of your urine. It is often done to check for a urinary tract infections; kidney problems; or diabetes. You may also have one during a checkup; if you are admitted to the hospital; before you have surgery; or if you are pregnant.  It can also monitor some medical conditions and treatments.A urinalysis involves checking the urine forIts colorIts appearance (whether it is clear or cloudy)Any odorThe pH level (acidity)Whether there are substances that are not normally in urine; such as blood; too much protein; glucose; ketones; and bilirubinWhether there are cells; crystals; and casts (tube-shaped proteins)Whether it contains bacteria or other germs
Ostomy,https://medlineplus.gov/ostomy.html,An ostomy is surgery to create an opening (stoma) from an area inside the body to the outside. It treats certain diseases of the digestive or urinary systems. It can be permanent; when an organ must be removed.  It can be temporary; when the organ needs time to heal.  The organ could be the small intestine; colon; rectum; or bladder. With an ostomy; there must be a new way for wastes to leave the body. There are many different types of ostomy. Some examples areIleostomy - the bottom of the small intestine (ileum) is attached to the stoma. This bypasses the colon; rectum and anus.Colostomy - the colon is attached to the stoma. This bypasses the rectum and the anus. Urostomy - the tubes that carry urine to the bladder are attached to the stoma. This bypasses the bladder.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Hives,https://medlineplus.gov/hives.html,Hives are red and sometimes itchy bumps on your skin. An allergic reaction to a drug or food usually causes them. Allergic reactions cause your body to release chemicals that can make your skin swell up in hives. People who have other allergies are more likely to get hives than other people.  Other causes include infections  and stress.Hives are very common.  They usually go away on their own; but if you have a serious case; you might need medicine or a shot. In rare cases; hives can cause a dangerous swelling in your airways; making it hard to breathe - which is a medical emergency.
Usher Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/ushersyndrome.html,Usher syndrome is an inherited disease that causes serious hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa; an eye disorder that causes your vision to get worse over time. It is the most common condition that affects both hearing and vision.There are three types of Usher syndrome:People with type I are deaf from birth and have severe balance problems from a young age. Vision problems usually start by age 10 and lead to blindness.People with type II have moderate to severe hearing loss and normal balance. Vision problems start in the early teens and get worse more slowly than in type I.People with type III are born with normal hearing and near-normal balance but develop vision problems and then hearing loss.There is no cure. Tools such as hearing aids or cochlear implants can help some people. Training such as Braille instruction; low-vision services; or auditory training can also help.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
Vaginal Bleeding,https://medlineplus.gov/vaginalbleeding.html,Menstruation; or period; is a woman's monthly bleeding.Abnormal vaginal bleeding is different from normal menstrual periods. It could be bleeding that is between periods; is very heavy; or lasts much longer than usual. It also includes bleeding that happens before puberty or after menopause. Causes can includeUterine fibroids or polypsHormone problemsHormone pills; such as birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy (menopausal hormone therapy)Cancer of the cervix; ovaries; uterus or vaginaThyroid problemsBleeding during pregnancy can have several different causes. It is not always serious; but to be safe you should contact your health care provider right away.Pelvic exams; blood tests; imaging tests; and other procedures can help your health care provider diagnose the problem. Treatment depends on the cause. Treatments may include medicines; hormones; and surgery.
Uterine Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/uterinecancer.html,The uterus; or womb; is the place where a baby grows when a women is pregnant. There are different types of uterine cancer. The most common type starts in the endometrium; the lining of the uterus. This type is also called endometrial cancer.The symptoms of uterine cancer includeAbnormal vaginal bleeding or dischargeTrouble urinatingPelvic painPain during intercourseUterine cancer usually happens after menopause. It is more common in women who have obesity. You also have a higher risk if you took estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy (menopausal hormone therapy) for many years.Tests to find uterine cancer include a pelvic exam; imaging tests; and a biopsy. The most common treatment is a hysterectomy; which is surgery to remove the uterus. Sometimes the surgery also removes the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Other treatments include hormone therapy; radiation therapy; and chemotherapy. Some women get more than one type of treatment.NIH: National Cancer Institute
Cervix Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/cervixdisorders.html,The cervix is the lower part of the uterus; the place where a baby grows during pregnancy. The cervix has a small opening that expands during childbirth. It also allows menstrual blood to leave a woman's body.Your health care provider may perform a Pap test during your health checkup to look for changes to the cells of the cervix; including cervical cancer. Other problems with the cervix include:Cervicitis - inflammation of the cervix. This is usually from an infection.Cervical incompetence - This can happen during pregnancy.  The opening of the cervix widens long before the baby is due.Cervical polyps and cysts - abnormal growths on the cervix
Uterine Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/uterinediseases.html,The uterus; or womb; is the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant. The first sign of a problem with the uterus may be bleeding between periods or after sex. Causes can include hormones; thyroid problems; fibroids; polyps; cancer; infection; or pregnancy.Treatment depends on the cause. Sometimes birth control pills treat hormonal imbalances. If a thyroid problem is the cause; treating it may also stop the bleeding. If you have cancer or hyperplasia; an overgrowth of normal cells in the uterus; you may need surgery.With two other uterine problems; tissue that normally lines the uterus grows where it is not supposed to.  In endometriosis; it grows outside the uterus.  In adenomyosis; it grows in the uterus's outside walls. Pain medicine may help. Other treatments include hormones and surgery.
Uterine Fibroids,https://medlineplus.gov/uterinefibroids.html,Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors in women of childbearing age. Fibroids are made of muscle cells and other tissues that grow in and around the wall of the uterus; or womb. The cause of fibroids is unknown. Risk factors include being African American or being overweight.Many women with fibroids have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms; they may includeHeavy or painful periods or bleeding between periods Feeling "full" in the lower abdomen Urinating often Pain during sex Lower back pain Reproductive problems; such as infertility; multiple miscarriages or early laborYour health care provider may find fibroids during a gynecological exam or by using imaging tests.  Treatment includes drugs that can slow or stop their growth; or surgery.  If you have no symptoms; you may not even need treatment. Many women with fibroids can get pregnant naturally. For those who cannot; infertility treatments may help.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development

Pelvic Support Problems,https://medlineplus.gov/pelvicsupportproblems.html,The pelvic floor is a group of muscles and other tissues that form a sling or hammock across the pelvis. In women; it holds the uterus; bladder; bowel; and other pelvic organs in place so that they can work properly.  The pelvic floor can become weak or be injured. The main causes are pregnancy and childbirth. Other causes include being overweight; radiation treatment; surgery; and getting older.Common symptoms includeFeeling heaviness; fullness; pulling; or aching in the vagina. It gets worse by the end of the day or during a bowel movement.Seeing or feeling a "bulge" or "something coming out" of the vaginaHaving a hard time starting to urinate or emptying the bladder completelyHaving frequent urinary tract infectionsLeaking urine when you cough; laugh; or exerciseFeeling an urgent or frequent need to urinateFeeling pain while urinatingLeaking stool or having a hard time controlling gasBeing constipatedHaving a hard time making it to the bathroom in timeYour health care provider diagnoses the problem with a physical exam; a pelvic exam; or special tests. Treatments include special pelvic muscle exercises called Kegel exercises. A mechanical support device called a pessary helps some women. Surgery and medicines are other treatments.NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development

Childhood Immunization,https://medlineplus.gov/childhoodimmunization.html,Today; children in the United States routinely get vaccines that protect them from more than a dozen diseases such as measles; polio; tetanus; diphtheria; and pertussis (whooping cough). Most of these diseases are now at their lowest levels in history; thanks to years of immunization. Children must get at least some vaccines before they may attend school.Vaccines help make you immune to serious diseases without getting sick first. Without a vaccine; you must actually get a disease in order to become immune to the germ that causes it. Vaccines work best when they are given at certain ages. For example; children don't receive measles vaccine until they are at least one year old. If it is given earlier it might not work as well.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes a schedule for childhood vaccines.Although some of the vaccines you receive as a child provide protection for many years; adults need immunizations too.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Immunization,https://medlineplus.gov/immunization.html,Shots may hurt a little; but the diseases they can prevent are a lot worse.  Some are even life-threatening. Immunization shots; or vaccinations; are essential. They protect against things like measles; mumps; rubella; hepatitis B; polio; tetanus; diphtheria; and pertussis (whooping cough). Immunizations are important for adults as well as children.Your immune system helps your body fight germs by producing substances to combat them. Once it does; the immune system "remembers" the germ and can fight it again. Vaccines contain germs that have been killed or weakened. When given to a healthy person; the vaccine triggers the immune system to respond and thus build immunity. Before vaccines; people became immune only by actually getting a disease and surviving it. Immunizations are an easier and less risky way to become immune. NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

Doctors prescribed DES in the 1950's to prevent miscarriages. You are also at higher risk if you have had abnormal cells in the vagina; cervix; or uterus.It often doesn't have early symptoms. However; see your doctor if you noticeBleeding that is not your periodA vaginal lump Pelvic pain A Pap test can find abnormal cells that may be cancer. Vaginal cancer can often be cured in its early stages. Treatment might include surgery; radiation therapy; and chemotherapy.NIH: National Cancer Institute

Yeast Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/yeastinfections.html,Candida is the scientific name for yeast. It is a fungus that lives almost everywhere; including in your body. Usually; your immune system keeps yeast under control. If you are sick or taking antibiotics; it can multiply and cause an infection. Yeast infections affect different parts of the body in different ways: Thrush is a yeast infection that causes white patches in your mouth Candida esophagitis is thrush that spreads to your esophagus; the tube that takes food from your mouth to your stomach. It can make it hard or painful to swallow. Women can get vaginal yeast infections; causing vaginitisYeast infections of the skin cause itching and rashes Yeast infections in your bloodstream can be life-threatening Antifungal medicines get rid of yeast infections in most people.

Valley Fever,https://medlineplus.gov/valleyfever.html,Valley Fever is a disease caused by a fungus (or mold) called Coccidioides. The fungi live in the soil of dry areas like the southwestern U.S. You get it from inhaling the spores of the fungus. The infection cannot spread from person to person.Anyone can get Valley Fever. But it's most common among older adults; especially those 60 and older. People who have recently moved to an area where it occurs are at highest risk for infection. Other people at higher risk includeWorkers in jobs that expose them to soil dust.   These include construction workers; agricultural workers; and military forces doing field training.African Americans and AsiansWomen in their third trimester of pregnancyPeople with weak immune systemsValley Fever is often mild; with no symptoms. If you have symptoms; they may include a flu-like illness; with fever; cough; headache; rash; and muscle aches. Most people get better within several weeks or months. A small number of people may develop a chronic lung or widespread infection.Valley Fever is diagnosed by testing your blood; other body fluids; or tissues. Many people with the acute infection get better without treatment. In some cases; doctors may prescribe antifungal drugs for acute infections. Severe infections require antifungal drugs.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Heart Valve Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/heartvalvediseases.html,Your heart has four valves. Normally; these valves open to let blood flow through or out of your heart; and then shut to keep it from flowing backward. But sometimes they don't work properly. If they don't; you could haveRegurgitation - when blood leaks back through the valve in the wrong directionMitral valve prolapse - when one of the valves; the mitral valve; has "floppy" flaps and doesn't close tightly. It's one of the most common heart valve conditions. Sometimes it causes regurgitation.Stenosis - when the valve doesn't open enough and blocks blood flowValve problems can be present at birth or caused by infections; heart attacks; or heart disease or damage. The main sign of heart valve disease is an unusual heartbeat sound called a heart murmur. Your doctor can hear a heart murmur with a stethoscope. But many people have heart murmurs without having a problem. Heart tests can show if you have a heart valve disease. Some valve problems are minor and do not need treatment. Others might require medicine; medical procedures; or surgery to repair or replace the valve.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Antibiotic Resistance,https://medlineplus.gov/antibioticresistance.html,Antibiotics are medicines that fight bacterial infections. Used properly; they can save lives. But there is a growing problem of antibiotic resistance. It happens when bacteria change and become able to resist the effects of an antibiotic. Using antibiotics can lead to resistance. Each time you take antibiotics; sensitive bacteria are killed. But resistant germs may be left to grow and multiply. They can spread to other people. They can also cause infections that certain antibiotics cannot cure.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one example. It causes infections that are resistant to several common antibiotics.To help prevent antibiotic resistanceDon't use antibiotics for viruses like colds or flu. Antibiotics don't work on viruses.Don't pressure your doctor to give you an antibiotic. When you take antibiotics; follow the directions carefully. Finish your medicine even if you feel better.  If you stop treatment too soon; some bacteria may survive and re-infect you.Don't save antibiotics for later or use someone else's prescription.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
E-Cigarettes,https://medlineplus.gov/ecigarettes.html,E-cigarettes; or electronic cigarettes; are battery-operated smoking devices.  They often look like cigarettes; but work differently.  Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. The user puffs on the mouthpiece of a cartridge. This causes a vaporizer to heat the liquid inside the cartridge. The liquid contains nicotine; flavorings; and other chemicals. The heated liquid turns into the vapor that is inhaled.Some people think that e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes; and that they can be used to help people quit smoking.  But not much is known about the health risks of using them; or whether they do help people quit smoking.  However we do know about some dangers of e-cigarettes:They contain nicotine; which is addictiveThey contain other potentially harmful chemicalsThere is a link between e-cigarette use and tobacco cigarette use in teensThe liquid in e-cigarettes can cause nicotine poisoning if someone drinks; sniffs; or touches it NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse
Chickenpox,https://medlineplus.gov/chickenpox.html,Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Most cases are in children under age 15; but older children and adults can get it.  It spreads very easily from one person to another.The classic symptom of chickenpox is an uncomfortable; itchy rash. The rash turns into fluid-filled blisters and eventually into scabs. It usually shows up on the face; chest; and back and then spreads to the rest of the body. Other symptoms includeFeverHeadacheTirednessLoss of appetiteChickenpox is usually mild and lasts 5 to 10 days. Calamine lotions and oatmeal baths can help with itching. Acetaminophen can treat the fever. Do not use aspirin for chickenpox; that combination can cause Reye syndrome.Chickenpox can sometimes cause serious problems. Adults; babies; teenagers; pregnant women; and those with weak immune systems tend to get sicker from it. They may need to take antiviral medicines.Once you catch chickenpox; the virus usually stays in your body.  You probably will not get chickenpox again; but the virus can cause shingles in adults. A chickenpox vaccine can help prevent most cases of chickenpox; or make it less severe if you do get it.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Varicose Veins,https://medlineplus.gov/varicoseveins.html,Varicose veins are swollen; twisted veins that you can see just under the skin. They usually occur in the legs; but also can form in other parts of the body. Hemorrhoids are a type of varicose vein.Your veins have one-way valves that help keep blood flowing toward your heart. If the valves are weak or damaged; blood can back up and pool in your veins. This causes the veins to swell; which can lead to varicose veins.Varicose veins are very common. You are more at risk if you are older; are female; have obesity; don't exercise; or have a family history of varicose veins. They can also be more common in pregnancy.Doctors often diagnose varicose veins from a physical exam. Sometimes you may need additional tests.Exercising; losing weight; elevating your legs when resting; and not crossing them when sitting can help keep varicose veins from getting worse. Wearing loose clothing and avoiding long periods of standing can also help. If varicose veins are painful or you don't like the way they look; your doctor may recommend procedures to remove them.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

They may also become nauseated and vomit.  Migraine is three times more common in women than in men. Some people can tell when they are about to have a migraine because they see flashing lights or zigzag lines or they temporarily lose their vision.  Many things can trigger a migraine. These include    Anxiety  Stress  Lack of food or sleep   Exposure to light  Hormonal changes (in women)  Doctors used to believe migraines were linked to the opening and narrowing of blood vessels in the head. Now they believe the cause is related to genes that control the activity of some brain cells.  Medicines can help prevent migraine attacks or help relieve symptoms of attacks when they happen. For many people; treatments to relieve stress can also help. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Vasculitis,https://medlineplus.gov/vasculitis.html,Vasculitis is an inflammation of the blood vessels. It happens when the body's immune system attacks the blood vessel by mistake. It can happen because of an infection; a medicine; or another disease. The cause is often unknown.Vasculitis can affect arteries; veins and capillaries. Arteries are vessels that carry blood from the heart to the body's organs. Veins are the vessels that carry blood back to the heart. Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that connect the small arteries and veins. When a blood vessel becomes inflamed; it can Narrow; making it more difficult for blood to get through  Close off completely so that blood can't get through  Stretch and weaken so much that it bulges.  The bulge is called an aneurysm. If it  bursts; it can cause dangerous bleeding inside the body.Symptoms of vasculitis can vary; but usually include fever; swelling and a general sense of feeling ill. The main goal of treatment is to stop the inflammation. Steroids and other medicines to stop inflammation are often helpful.NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute

Vitamin D,https://medlineplus.gov/vitamind.html,Vitamins are substances that your body needs to grow and develop normally. Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Calcium is one of the main building blocks of bone. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone diseases such as osteoporosis or rickets.  Vitamin D also has a role in your nerve; muscle; and immune systems.You can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin; from your diet; and from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D naturally after exposure to sunlight. However; too much sun exposure can lead to skin aging and skin cancer.  So many people try to get their vitamin D from other sources.Vitamin D-rich foods include egg yolks; saltwater fish; and liver.  Some other foods; like milk and cereal; often have added vitamin D. You can also take vitamin D supplements.  Check with your health care provider to see how much you should take.  People who might need extra vitamin D includeSeniorsBreastfed infantsPeople with dark skinPeople with  certain conditions; such as liver diseases; cystic fibrosis and Crohn's diseasePeople who have obesity or have had gastric bypass surgeryNIH: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements
Vitamin D Deficiency,https://medlineplus.gov/vitaminddeficiency.html,What is vitamin D deficiency?Vitamin D deficiency means that you are not getting enough vitamin D to stay healthy.Why do I need vitamin D and how do I get it?Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Calcium is one of the main building blocks of bone. Vitamin D also has a role in your nervous; muscle; and immune systems.You can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin; from your diet; and from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D naturally after exposure to sunlight. But too much sun exposure can lead to skin aging and skin cancer; so many people try to get their vitamin D from other sources.How much vitamin D do I need?The amount of vitamin D you need each day depends on your age.  The recommended amounts; in international units (IU); areBirth to 12 months: 400 IUChildren 1-13 years: 600 IUTeens 14-18 years: 600 IUAdults 19-70 years: 600 IUAdults 71 years and older: 800 IUPregnant and breastfeeding women: 600 IUPeople at high risk of vitamin D deficiency may need more. Check with your health care provider about how much you need.What causes vitamin D deficiency?You can become deficient in vitamin D for different reasons:You don't get enough vitamin D in your dietYou don't absorb enough vitamin D from food (a malabsorption problem)You don't get enough exposure to sunlight.Your liver or kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form in the body.You take medicines that interfere with your body's ability to convert or absorb vitamin DWho is at risk of vitamin D deficiency?Some people are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency:Breastfed infants; because human milk is a poor source of vitamin D. If you are breastfeeding; give your infant a supplement of 400 IU of vitamin D every day.Older adults; because your skin doesn't make vitamin D when exposed to sunlight as efficiently as when you were young; and your kidneys are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form.People with dark skin; which has less ability to produce vitamin D from the sun.People with disorders such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease who don't handle fat properly; because vitamin D needs fat to be absorbed.People who have obesity; because their body fat binds to some vitamin D and prevents it from getting into the blood.People who have had gastric bypass surgeryPeople with osteoporosisPeople with chronic kidney or liver disease.People with hyperparathyroidism (too much of a hormone that controls the body's calcium level)People with sarcoidosis; tuberculosis; histoplasmosis; or other granulomatous disease (disease with granulomas; collections of cells caused by chronic inflammation)People with some lymphomas; a type of cancer.People who take medicines that affect vitamin D metabolism; such as cholestyramine (a cholesterol drug); anti-seizure drugs; glucocorticoids; antifungal drugs; and HIV/AIDS medicines.Talk with your health care provider if you are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.  There is a blood test which can measure how much vitamin D is in your body.What problems does vitamin D deficiency cause?Vitamin D deficiency can lead to a loss of bone density; which can contribute to osteoporosis and fractures.Severe vitamin D deficiency can also lead to other diseases. In children; it can cause rickets. Rickets is a rare disease that causes the bones to become soft and bend. African American infants and children are at higher risk of getting rickets. In adults; severe vitamin D deficiency leads to osteomalacia. Osteomalacia causes weak bones; bone pain; and muscle weakness.Researchers are studying vitamin D for its possible connections to several medical conditions; including diabetes; high blood pressure; cancer; and autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis. They need to do more research before they can understand the effects of vitamin D on these conditions.How can I get more vitamin D?There are a few foods that naturally have some vitamin D:Fatty fish such as salmon; tuna; and mackerelBeef liverCheeseMushroomsEgg yolksYou can also get vitamin D from fortified foods. You can check the food labels to find out whether a food has vitamin D. Foods that often have added vitamin D includeMilkBreakfast cerealsOrange juiceOther dairy products; such as yogurtSoy drinksVitamin D is in many multivitamins. There are also vitamin D supplements; both in pills and a liquid for babies.If you have vitamin D deficiency; the treatment is with supplements. Check with your health care provider about how much you need to take; how often you need to take it; and how long you need to take it.Can too much vitamin D be harmful?Getting too much vitamin D (known as vitamin D toxicity) can be harmful. Signs of toxicity include nausea; vomiting; poor appetite; constipation; weakness; and weight loss. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys. Too much vitamin D also raises the level of calcium in your blood. High levels of blood calcium (hypercalcemia) can cause confusion; disorientation; and problems with heart rhythm.Most cases of vitamin D toxicity happen when someone overuses vitamin D supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces.

It usually starts in childhood.  Sometimes the symptoms are present at birth.Type 2 (NF2) causes hearing loss; ringing in the ears; and poor balance. Symptoms often start in the teen years.Schwannomatosis causes intense pain. It is the rarest type.Doctors diagnose the different types based on the symptoms. Genetic testing is also used to diagnose NF1 and NF2. There is no cure. Treatment can help control symptoms. Depending on the type of disease and how serious it is; treatment may include surgery to remove tumors; radiation therapy; and medicines.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Platelet Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/plateletdisorders.html,Platelets are little pieces of blood cells. Platelets help wounds heal and prevent bleeding by forming blood clots. Your bone marrow makes platelets.  Problems can result from having too few or too many platelets; or from platelets that do not work properly.If your blood has a low number of platelets; it is called thrombocytopenia. This can put you at risk for mild to serious bleeding.   If your blood has too many platelets; you may have a higher risk of blood clots.  With other platelet disorders; the platelets do not work as they should.  For example; in von Willebrand Disease; the platelets cannot stick together or cannot attach to blood vessel walls.  This can cause excessive bleeding.  Treatment of platelet disorders depends on the cause.  NIH: National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute
Antibiotic Resistance,https://medlineplus.gov/antibioticresistance.html,Antibiotics are medicines that fight bacterial infections. Used properly; they can save lives. But there is a growing problem of antibiotic resistance. It happens when bacteria change and become able to resist the effects of an antibiotic. Using antibiotics can lead to resistance. Each time you take antibiotics; sensitive bacteria are killed. But resistant germs may be left to grow and multiply. They can spread to other people. They can also cause infections that certain antibiotics cannot cure.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one example. It causes infections that are resistant to several common antibiotics.To help prevent antibiotic resistanceDon't use antibiotics for viruses like colds or flu. Antibiotics don't work on viruses.Don't pressure your doctor to give you an antibiotic. When you take antibiotics; follow the directions carefully. Finish your medicine even if you feel better.  If you stop treatment too soon; some bacteria may survive and re-infect you.Don't save antibiotics for later or use someone else's prescription.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

The rest are called non-Hodgkin lymphomas.Non-Hodgkin lymphomas begin when a type of white blood cell; called a T cell or B cell; becomes abnormal. The cell divides again and again; making more and more abnormal cells. These abnormal cells can spread to almost any other part of the body. Most of the time; doctors don't know why a person gets non-Hodgkin lymphoma. You are at increased risk if you have a weakened immune system or have certain types of infections.Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can cause many symptoms; such as Swollen; painless lymph nodes in the neck; armpits or groinUnexplained weight loss Fever Soaking night sweats Coughing; trouble breathing or chest pain Weakness and tiredness that don't go away Pain; swelling or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen Your doctor will diagnose lymphoma with a physical exam; blood tests; a chest x-ray; and a biopsy.  Treatments include chemotherapy; radiation therapy; targeted therapy; biological therapy; or therapy to remove proteins from the blood. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.  Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer. If you don't have symptoms; you may not need treatment right away. This is called watchful waiting.NIH: National Cancer Institute

West Nile Virus,https://medlineplus.gov/westnilevirus.html,West Nile virus (WNV) is an infectious disease that first appeared in the United States in 1999.  Infected mosquitoes spread the virus that causes it. People who get WNV usually have no symptoms or mild symptoms.  The symptoms include a fever; headache; body aches; skin rash; and swollen lymph glands.  They can last a few days to several weeks; and usually go away on their own.If West Nile virus enters the brain; however; it can be life-threatening.  It may cause inflammation of the brain; called encephalitis; or inflammation of the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord; called meningitis. A physical exam; health history and laboratory tests can diagnose it.Older people and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk.  There are no specific vaccines or treatments for human WNV disease.  The best way to avoid WNV is to prevent mosquito bites:Use insect repellentGet rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots; buckets or barrelsStay indoors between dusk and dawn; when mosquitoes are most activeUse screens on windows to keep mosquitoes outNIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

Wilson Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/wilsondisease.html,Wilson disease is a rare inherited disorder that prevents your body from getting rid of extra copper.  You need a small amount of copper from food to stay healthy. Too much copper is poisonous.Normally; your liver releases extra copper into bile; a digestive fluid.  With Wilson disease; the copper builds up in your liver; and it releases the copper directly into your bloodstream. This can cause damage to your brain; kidneys; and eyes.Wilson disease is present at birth; but symptoms usually start between ages 5 and 35. It first attacks the liver; the central nervous system or both. The most characteristic sign is a rusty brown ring around the cornea of the eye. A physical exam and laboratory tests can diagnose it.Treatment is with drugs to remove the extra copper from your body.  You need to take medicine and follow a low-copper diet for the rest of your life. Don't eat shellfish or liver; as these foods may contain high levels of copper.  At the beginning of treatment; you'll also need to avoid chocolate; mushrooms; and nuts.

Various treatments soothe dry skin and reduce the appearance of age spots. NIH: National Institute on Aging
Wrist Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/wristinjuriesanddisorders.html,Your wrist is made up of eight small bones known as carpals. They support a tube that runs through your wrist. That tube; called the carpal tunnel; has tendons and a nerve inside. It is covered by a ligament; which holds it in place.  Wrist pain is common. Repetitive motion can damage your wrist. Everyday activities like typing; racquet sports or sewing can cause pain; or even carpal tunnel syndrome. Wrist pain with bruising and swelling can be a sign of injury. The signs of a possible fracture include misshapen joints and inability to move your wrist. Some wrist fractures are a result of osteoporosis. Other common causes of pain are   Sprains and strains Tendinitis Arthritis Gout and pseudogout
X-Rays,https://medlineplus.gov/xrays.html,X-rays are a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves. X-ray imaging creates pictures of the inside of your body. The images show the parts of your body in different shades of black and white. This is because different tissues absorb different amounts of radiation. Calcium in bones absorbs x-rays the most; so bones look white. Fat and other soft tissues absorb less; and look gray. Air absorbs the least; so lungs look black.The most familiar use of x-rays is checking for broken bones; but x-rays are also used in other ways. For example; chest x-rays can spot pneumonia. Mammograms use x-rays to look for breast cancer.When you have an x-ray; you may wear a lead apron to protect certain parts of your body. The amount of radiation you get from an x-ray is small. For example; a chest x-ray gives out a radiation dose similar to the amount of radiation you're naturally exposed to from the environment over 10 days.
Dry Mouth,https://medlineplus.gov/drymouth.html,Dry mouth is the feeling that there is not enough saliva in your mouth. Everyone has a dry mouth once in a while - if they are nervous; upset or under stress.

Things you can do include sipping water; avoiding drinks with caffeine; tobacco; and alcohol; and chewing sugarless gum or sucking on sugarless hard candy.NIH: National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research
Yeast Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/yeastinfections.html,Candida is the scientific name for yeast. It is a fungus that lives almost everywhere; including in your body. Usually; your immune system keeps yeast under control. If you are sick or taking antibiotics; it can multiply and cause an infection. Yeast infections affect different parts of the body in different ways: Thrush is a yeast infection that causes white patches in your mouth Candida esophagitis is thrush that spreads to your esophagus; the tube that takes food from your mouth to your stomach. It can make it hard or painful to swallow. Women can get vaginal yeast infections; causing vaginitisYeast infections of the skin cause itching and rashes Yeast infections in your bloodstream can be life-threatening Antifungal medicines get rid of yeast infections in most people. If you have a weak immune system; treatment might be more difficult.
Hemorrhagic Fevers,https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhagicfevers.html,Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of illnesses caused by four families of viruses. These include the Ebola and Marburg; Lassa fever; and yellow fever viruses. VHFs have common features: they affect many organs; they damage the blood vessels; and they affect the body's ability to regulate itself. Some VHFs cause mild disease; but some; like Ebola or Marburg; cause severe disease and death.VHFs are found around the world. Specific diseases are usually limited to areas where the animals that carry them live. For example; Lassa fever is limited to rural areas of West Africa where rats and mice carry the virus.The risk for travelers is low; but you should avoid visiting areas where there are disease outbreaks. Because there are no effective treatments for some of these viral infections; there is concern about their use in bioterrorism.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Foodborne Illness,https://medlineplus.gov/foodborneillness.html,Each year; around 48 million people in the United States get sick from contaminated food. Common causes include bacteria and viruses. Less often; the cause may be a parasite or a harmful chemical; such as a high amount of pesticides. Symptoms of foodborne illness depend on the cause. They can be mild or serious. They usually includeUpset stomachAbdominal crampsNausea and vomitingDiarrheaFeverDehydrationMost foodborne illnesses are acute. This means that they happen suddenly and last a short time.It takes several steps to get food from the farm or fishery to your dining table. Contamination can happen during any of these steps. For example; it can happen toRaw meat during slaughterFruits and vegetables when they are growing or when they are processedRefrigerated foods when they are left on a loading dock in warm weatherBut it can also happen in your kitchen if you leave food out for more than 2 hours at room temperature. Handling food safely can help prevent foodborne illnesses.Most people with foodborne illness get better on their own. It is important to replace lost fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration. If your health care provider can diagnose the specific cause; you may get medicines such as antibiotics to treat it. For more serious illness; you may need treatment at a hospital.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Zika Virus,https://medlineplus.gov/zikavirus.html,Zika is a virus that is spread mostly by mosquitoes. A pregnant mother can pass it to her baby during pregnancy or around the time of birth. It can spread through sexual contact. There have also been reports that the virus has spread through blood transfusions. There have been outbreaks of Zika virus in the United States; Africa; Southeast Asia; the Pacific Islands; parts of the Caribbean; and Central and South America.Most people who get the virus do not get sick. One in five people do get symptoms; which can include a fever; rash; joint pain; and conjunctivitis (pinkeye). Symptoms are usually mild; and start 2 to 7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.A blood test can tell whether you have the infection. There are no vaccines or medicines to treat it. Drinking lots of fluids; resting; and taking acetaminophen might help.Zika can cause microcephaly (a serious birth defect of the brain) and other problems in babies whose mothers were infected while pregnant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that pregnant women do not travel to areas where there is a Zika virus outbreak. If you do decide to travel; first talk to your doctor. You should also be careful to prevent mosquito bites:Use insect repellentWear clothes that cover your arms; legs; and feetStay in places that have air conditioning or that use window and door screensCenters for Disease Control and Prevention
Minerals,https://medlineplus.gov/minerals.html,Minerals are important for your body to stay healthy. Your body uses minerals for many different jobs; including keeping your bones; muscles; heart; and brain working properly. Minerals are also important for making enzymes and hormones.There are two kinds of minerals: macrominerals and trace minerals. You need larger amounts of macrominerals. They include calcium; phosphorus; magnesium; sodium; potassium; chloride and sulfur. You only need small amounts of trace minerals. They include iron; manganese; copper; iodine; zinc; cobalt; fluoride and selenium. Most people get the amount of minerals they need by eating a wide variety of foods. In some cases; your doctor may recommend a mineral supplement. People who have certain health problems or take some medicines may need to get less of one of the minerals. For example; people with chronic kidney disease need to limit foods that are high in potassium.
Acne,https://medlineplus.gov/acne.html,Acne is a common skin disease that causes pimples. Pimples form when hair follicles under your skin clog up. Most pimples form on the face; neck; back; chest; and shoulders. Anyone can get acne; but it is common in teenagers and young adults. It is not serious; but it can cause scars.No one knows exactly what causes acne. Hormone changes; such as those during the teenage years and pregnancy; probably play a role. There are many myths about what causes acne. Chocolate and greasy foods are often blamed; but there is little evidence that foods have much effect on acne in most people. Another common myth is that dirty skin causes acne; however; blackheads and pimples are not caused by dirt. Stress doesn't cause acne; but stress can make it worse.If you have acneClean your skin gently Try not to touch your skin Avoid the sun Treatments for acne include medicines and creams.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
Animal Diseases and Your Health,https://medlineplus.gov/animaldiseasesandyourhealth.html,Animal diseases that people can catch are called zoonoses.   Many diseases affecting humans can be traced to animals or animal products. You can get a disease directly from an animal; or indirectly; through the environment.Farm animals can carry diseases. If you touch them or things they have touched; like fencing or buckets; wash your hands thoroughly. Adults should make sure children who visit farms or petting zoos wash up as well. Though they may be cute and cuddly; wild animals may carry germs; viruses; and parasites. Deer and deer mice carry ticks that cause Lyme disease. Some wild animals may carry rabies. Enjoy wildlife from a distance.Pets can also make you sick. Reptiles pose a particular risk. Turtles; snakes and iguanas can transmit Salmonella bacteria to their owners. You can get rabies from an infected dog or toxoplasmosis from handling kitty litter of an infected cat. The chance that your dog or cat will make you sick is small. You can reduce the risk by practicing good hygiene; keeping pet areas clean and keeping your pets' shots up-to-date.
